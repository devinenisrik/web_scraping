      "        \"On September 21, 2023, the Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) released the Draft Master Direction on treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters. The purpose behind the draft is to solicit public comments on proposed regulations to tighten the norms applicable to wilful defaulters. While the draft regulations significantly strengthen the wilful defaulter norms, they also raise certain vital concerns.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Applicable Legal Regime\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The master circular on wilful defaulters establishes a system to identify and disseminate credit information regarding wilful defaulters to banks and financial institutions, to restrict access to finance. The regime recognises “all banks and financial institutions” to which money is owed by “individuals, juristic persons, other forms of business enterprises” as lenders.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Under the current regime, lenders are obligated to identify and share information about wilful defaulters with an outstanding debt of Rs. 25 Lakhs and above. A “wilful default” is deemed to have occurred if the borrower has failed to meet payment obligations to the lender despite having the ability to repay, diverted such funds for other purposes, siphoned-off such funds, or disposed-off the property which was pledged to lenders for the purpose of securing the loan.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Significantly, lenders have the sole power to declare entities as wilful defaulters. The circular provides for a two-tiered mechanism consisting of an identification committee and a review committee to be constituted for identification of wilful defaulters. In this regard, the identification committee is tasked with issuing a show-cause notice against the defaulter and calling for their submissions. The committee has the discretion to allow a personal hearing to the defaulter if deemed necessary. After receiving submissions, a reasoned order must be passed, which will be considered by the review committee for classification of entities as wilful defaulters.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Where the wilful defaulter is a company, even its promoters and whole-time directors at the relevant time would be classified as wilful defaulters. However, non-whole-time directors are ordinarily exempted from this classification, unless some active participation or knowledge is established. Nevertheless, non-whole time promoter directors cannot claim exemption under the safe-harbour clause.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Upon being listed as a wilful defaulter, no additional facilities should be granted by any lender, and they are barred from institutional finance for floating new ventures for five years after their removal from the list of wilful defaulters. Further, lenders must initiate appropriate criminal proceedings against wilful defaulters and change such a unit’s management. Lenders must also incorporate covenants in loan agreements with borrower companies, prohibiting the induction of wilful defaulters to their board or ensuring expeditious removal therefrom.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Parallelly, SEBI’s (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2018 bar listed entities from issuing equity shares and convertible securities to the public where they, or any of their promoters or directors, are wilful defaulters. Nevertheless, the regulations permit the listed entity to raise capital through a rights issue or preferential allotment, subject to certain disclosure requirements. Similarly, the SEBI (Issue and Listing of Non-Convertible Securities) Regulations, 2021 bar listed entities from issuing non-convertible securities such as debt instruments where they, or any of their promoters or directors, are wilful defaulters.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Proposed Changes \",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The draft directions seek to provide a non-discriminatory and transparent procedure for classifying a depositor as a wilful defaulter. This is sought to be done by incorporating principles of natural justice into the mechanism for identifying wilful defaulters. In addition to the written submissions made to the identification committee, defaulters may now also make written representations before the review committee within a reasonable time, which is proposed to be set at fifteen days. Additionally, the review committee shall provide to the defaulter an opportunity for a personal hearing, after which it shall take a decision on the matter. These changes come in light of the Supreme Court decision in SBI v Jah Developers, wherein principles of natural justice were read into RBI’s Master Circular on Wilful Defaulters, considering the grave consequences that ensued therefrom. It was held that defaulters must have the right of representation before the review committee, before it takes a decision.\",\n",

      "        \"Furthermore, non-banking financial companies (“NBFC’s”) are proposed to be included within the definition of a “lender”, allowing such entities also to classify borrowers as wilful defaulters. Additionally, the definition of “wilful default” is proposed to be expanded to include a failure to infuse equity that the borrower committed to do, based on which loans/concessions were provided, despite having the ability to do so.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The draft directions, for the first time, define “wilful defaulters”. Where the defaulter is a company, its promoters and directors associated at the relevant time will also be considered wilful defaulters. Where such individuals are wilful defaulters, all entities in which such person is a promoter or director or is responsible for its management, shall be deemed to be associated with it. Where the wilful defaulter is a company, its subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associate companies will be deemed to be associated with it.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"This assumes significance, as the proposed directions bar not only wilful defaulters, but also all its associated entities from availing any credit facility from lenders. This bar will also be effective for one year after the wilful defaulter is de-listed. It is also proposed to expedite the process of identifying wilful defaulters by imposing a six-month deadline for completing the classification process of entities as wilful defaulters after they have been declared as non-performing assets (“NPAs”).\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Critical Analysis of the Draft Directions\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The proposed directions represent a significant strengthening of the Reserve Bank’s norms on wilful defaulters, in response to India’s significant NPA crisis. They take a crucial step to address this crisis by proposing to classify NBFCs, including asset reconstruction companies (“ARCs”), as lenders, allowing them to be at par with banks vis-à-vis the identification of wilful defaulters and initiating penal action against them. This would incentivise the growth of ARCs in India with a favourable regulatory framework.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Nevertheless, the draft directions also raise certain concerns as regards their scope and implications. Firstly, while the RBI has attempted to satisfy the requirements of natural justice by providing an opportunity to the defaulters to make written representations and a personal hearing before the review committee, it retains the in-house mechanisms of banks to identify wilful defaulters. Apart from concerns regarding this mechanism’s susceptibility to bias, one may question the role of courts in reviewing the decision of the review committee, considering the significant consequences that such classification attracts, implicating Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution, as held in Jah Developers. However, the Calcutta High Court, in Kejriwal Mining Pvt. Ltd. v Allahabad Bank, ruled that the classification as a “wilful defaulter” may only be overturned by a court under its writ jurisdiction on grounds of patent illegality, arbitrariness, bias, or abuse of process. This narrow jurisdiction effectively permits private commercial entities to make decisions, which consequentially restrict fundamental rights under Article 19(1)(g) without any possibility of a substantive judicial review.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Secondly, by introducing the concept of associated entities (which are also barred from institutional finance) to the regime, the draft regulations make it more difficult for a liquidity-strapped wilfully defaulting company to be re-financed. When the defaulter is a company, the draft deems its promoters and whole-time directors also as wilful defaulters, making any other entity in which they are promoters or directors, associated entities. Currently, the defaulting company, its promoters, and whole-time directors are barred from institutional finance, while the company is further barred from accessing capital market (except by way of a rights issue or preferential allotment under SEBI’s regulation) and debt markets. Therefore, it is difficult for a liquidity-strapped defaulting company that is closely promoter-held to raise funds, as the promoters are barred from institutional finance.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Nevertheless, currently, re-financing is possible through other promoter-controlled entities, which have access to institutional finance. However, since the proposed directions bar associated entities from institutional finance, it would make it harder for such promoter-led entities to re-finance a liquidity strapped defaulting company. This may have the effect of prejudicing the interests of other shareholders in the wilfully defaulting company as it may struggle to raise adequate funds for its operations.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Finally, the proposed regulations give an expansive definition of associated entities. Any entity in which the wilful defaulter is a promoter or director is deemed to be an associated entity, without any distinction drawn between whole-time and non-whole-time directorships. This may have an unnecessarily wide effect on companies wherein the wilful defaulter may not even exercise control, in addition to the extant burden to remove such defaulters from their Board.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Conclusion\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The rising NPA scenario poses a significant threat to the Indian economy, necessitating a tightening of regulatory norms to tackle defaulters, including wilful defaulters. The draft directions represent a step towards addressal of this crisis by the Reserve Bank, by bringing NBFCs, especially ARCs, under the ambit of the wilful defaulter regime. Addressing the questions raised in this post would aid in the creation of a robust yet fair mechanism to mitigate the NPA situation.\",\n",

An appeal was preferred by the post office before the Punjab and Haryana High Court, contending that the CAT acted ultra vires while directing the Central Government to sanction posts and introduce the scheme for regularization.

The scope of enquiry while examining the issue of non-arbitrability is “prima facie”. Only in exceptional cases would the court reject reference where the claims are “manifestly and ex – facie non – arbitrable”.\",\n",

The Supreme Court noted that the heart of the dispute revolved around the action of NTPC in not returning the bank guarantees even after SPML issued a no-demand certificate. At the time of withdrawal of writ petition, SPML did not raise any allegation of coercion or economic duress.

Through its provisions, the Act aims to provide the concerned class of workers with crucial social security and essential benefits. Although the Code on Social Security 2022 recognizes gig and platform workers and seeks to extend benefits to them at a central level, its implementation is still in progress. In the interim, Rajasthan has taken a proactive step to address these issues on a state level, thereby setting a significant precedent for other Indian states.\",\n",

It tantalizingly promises subsistence and flexible work opportunities via platforms like Ola, Uber, Swiggy, Zomato, Amazon, Urban Company and more. These platforms often identify as tech aggregators, mediators, or facilitators, steadfastly avoiding the label of employers and treating their workers as partners or independent contractors, thereby evading accountability and responsibility. Even though many facets of employment, including mode of arrangements, payments, costs, fares, incentives, penalties, and market entry or exit, are frequently subject to rules resembling those found in formal job markets, the benefits associated with formal employment, such as stable working hours, decent work conditions, and substantial wages and social security, elude these workers. In this context, Rajasthan’s Act serves as a momentous legislation to gig workers, a growing segment of the workforce that operates outside traditional employer-employee relationships.\",\n",

The Act defines gig workers as individuals who perform work and earn income outside traditional employer-employee structures or those who work under contractual arrangements with terms and conditions leading to fixed payment rates, including all piece-rate work.\",\n",

In addition to the obvious benefits provided by such welfare cess, an ancillary advantage is that the calculation of this cess will compel companies to relinquish control over transaction-level data, which will now reside in a government-controlled database, accessible also to workers. Companies have long resisted such transparency, whereby customers would receive an upfront price, while the worker remained unaware of the actual amount and, consequently, had no insight into the effective commission rate imposed on that transaction.\",\n",

Furthermore, every gig worker already onboarded or registered with a platform must also be registered with the Board. This registration, bestowed with a Unique ID, remains valid indefinitely, irrespective of engagement duration. In turn of such registration, this Board is entrusted with the discharge of several critical responsibilities, including registering gig workers, aggregators, and primary employers within the state, integrating welfare cess deductions into platforms’ mechanisms, devising social security schemes for registered workers, ensuring accessibility to benefits, and engaging with unions to facilitate transparent consultations.\",\n",

      "        \"Redefining the Employer-Employee Relationship: A Missed Opportunity? \",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The primary shortcoming of the Act arises from the definitions assigned to gig workers and aggregators within the Act, which do not categorize gig workers as employees or aggregators as employers. There is a growing global consensus that many gig workers indeed fit within the broad definitions of employees and should be entitled to all the protections provided to traditional employees. However, Rajasthan’s Act sidesteps this issue by continuing to categorise the gig companies as aggregators. When gig workers are not officially recognized as employees, it raises the question of the extent to which aggregators can be held accountable. While some Indian platforms may include provisions for situations such as workplace accidents and resulting medical expenses, this approach risks transforming essential entitlements like occupational safety into acts of goodwill rather than legally mandated obligations.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Consequently, the Act suffers from a narrow scope, failing to incorporate existing labour laws into its purposive framework of protecting gig workers. This oversight allows for the persistence of long-standing practices of non-compliance with labour regulations and a circumvention of responsibilities regarding workplace entitlements and protections. This is despite the high degree of control exerted over these workers, a point underscored in various jurisdictions that have classified gig workers as employees to afford employee-level benefits and protections, including Australia, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Spain.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Furthermore, Australia and New Zealand have shifted their terminological focus from ‘employer’ and ‘employee’ to ‘person conducting a business or undertaking’ and ‘worker in their workplace’, thereby emphasizing the duty of businesses to ensure worker health and safety, amongst other benefits, regardless of the employment status, traditional or otherwise. While this represents an aspirational model for the labour landscape, India would face significant challenges in striving towards such a paradigm shift through a single leap. In order to approach this vision, Rajasthan’s Act has the potential to take an incremental step towards bridging the gap between traditional and non-traditional workers, by categorizing gig workers as employees, which the Act does not provide for at present.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"However, it is essential to acknowledge that in countries where workers have been equated to employees or have been offered high benefits, gig platforms have faced increased costs, leading to reduced job availability or cessation of operations. Therefore, developing countries with substantial presence of informal employment, such as India, Indonesia, and Thailand, have remained silent on gig worker employment status, as the risk of misclassifying gig workers is high and could prove extremely costly for workers and consumers. In this context, India appears to adopt a cautious approach, providing ad hoc targeted measures for more visible groups of informal workers. Nevertheless, maintaining gig workers as independent contractors with piecemeal benefits fails to plug gaps in current labour laws and social protection schemes, particularly in countries like India, which do not have an effective universal social safety net. This regulatory approach also risks introducing a multitude of fragmented measures, adding administrative burdens for both workers and companies.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Considering these challenges, India may benefit from introducing a third worker category, providing a more promising policy option that maintains worker autonomy while offering enhanced protections commensurate with the degree of control and dependence that the worker is under. Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, and certain other countries have implemented similar categories to encompass non-formal employment relationships and ensure entitlements to an appropriate level of rights and protections. Until such changes are introduced, the existing form of this legislation, designed to safeguard non-traditional workers, can act as a catalyst for discussions about expanding the category of workers entitled to the gamut of labour law protections.\",\n",

      "        \"Concluding Thoughts \",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The platform-based gig worker engagement model has traditionally offered aggregators a business structure with low liability from a legal compliance perspective. In a refreshing departure from this norm, Rajasthan’s legislation for gig sector workers marks the beginning of a new era in India’s labour landscape. By addressing the distinct needs of gig workers, who often operate under non-traditional employment terms, and extending them social security benefits, the state not only acknowledges the evolving nature of work but also works toward fostering a more robust and inclusive economy. The gig economy holds significant potential for economic empowerment, but its realization depends on ensuring that workers are granted adequate rights and legal protections, and that aggregators fulfil their roles and responsibilities.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"While it is important to create an environment that supports gig workers, solely focusing on their needs may inadvertently burden aggregators and hinder their business operations. Hence, it is imperative to not only extend benefits to gig workers but also facilitate the growth of aggregator businesses. This balanced approach is essential to ensure the sustainability of the gig economy, which many depend on. To fully harness the potential of this legislation and shape the trajectory of the gig economy in India and beyond, it is imperative that Rajasthan effectively implements the provisions of the Act while simultaneously refining them through the Rules under the Act.\",\n",

The informant agreed that since the ICAI is affiliated with the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), it is obligated to adhere to IFAC’s best practices, which include implementing a continuing professional development programme to ensure that its members regularly update their knowledge. However, the informant had a grievance with the policy that only the ICAI and its organs are allowed to conduct the CPE program’. He was of the view that “the ICAI is abusing its dominant position as a regulator to create a monopoly in the service of providing CPE seminars and therefore violating Sec. 4(1) of the Competition Act.” The informant wanted ICAI to outsource its function of running the CPE so that other market players could also participate in the market.\",\n",

Further conundrum involving SEBI and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC) also highlighted the complex interplay between regarding the recovery of funds and the imposition of a moratorium. The conflict arose from SEBI’s authority to seize the assets of the corporate debtor and the moratorium provisions established by the IBC, which explicitly prohibit such actions during the moratorium period.

Legislative intent defines the scope and limitations within which these bodies can operate. Any interference or allegations against such bodies should be evaluated against this legislative intent. The CCI does not have the authority to mandate a statutory body to outsource functions related to its statutory duties, even if those functions are considered economic activities. It would be incorrect to assume that simply because an activity falls under the definition of economic activity; it automatically necessitates the creation of an open market for that activity. Therefore, the CCI cannot enforce the outsourcing of activities by an organization or enterprise. The Court’s verdict in favor of the ICAI suggests that the CCI’s allegations overstepped the boundaries of delegated legislation. This reaffirms the significance of respecting the autonomy and regulatory authority granted to specialized bodies within the framework of delegated legislation.\",\n",

The Limitation Act is based on the idea that there must be a strict time limit for bringing appropriate actions in the courts. In doing so, it protects only the diligent litigants, not those careless about their rights. The court does not show indulgence if a creditor seeks redress from the court after the stipulated statutory period of limitation has passed. Debt is covered by the Limitation Act, and after the prescribed limitation period has passed, the debt becomes time-barred.

In any of these cases, such an agreement is a contract.” It is pertinent to note that the illustration (e) to the corresponding section is as follows: “(e) A owes B Rs. 1,000, but the debt is barred by the Limitation Act.

While section 18 of the Limitation Act deals with an acknowledgment, made by a debtor within the period of Limitation, the contractual obligation which a debtor enters into under the terms of section 25(3) of the Contract Act has no reference whatsoever to the acknowledged debt being within time or not. In that sense, the provision contained in section 25(3) is far wider in scope than the acknowledgment contemplated in section 18 of the Limitation Act.

A written promise to pay the barred debt is a valid contract. Such a promise constitutes novation and can form the basis of a suit independent of the original debt, “for it is well settled that the debt is not extinguished, the remedy gets barred by passage of time” as held by the Supreme Court in Bombay Dyeing & Mfg.

There exists a distinction between acknowledgment under Section 18 of the Limitation Act, 1963, and a promise within the meaning of Section 25 of the Contract Act. Both, the acknowledgment and the promise, respectively, in writing and signed by a party or their authorised agents, have the effect of resetting the clock of limitation. In the case of Sri Kapaleswarar Temple v. T. Tirunavukarasu is was observed that there is, however, a distinction between the nature of acknowledgement by a debtor under the respective provisions, inasmuch as, while both have the effect of giving a fresh lease of life to the enforceability of debt, an acknowledgement under Section 18 of the Limitation Act must be made on or before the date of expiry of the limitation period, whereas by its very nature a promise under Section 25(3) of the Contract Act will only be made after expiry of limitation period. In other words, a promise under Section 25(3) of the ICA made after the limitation period expires, would give a cause of action to the creditor to enforce the claim, notwithstanding the initial period of limitation, and the debt cannot be said to be barred.\",\n",

Consequently, SEBI passed an order imposing penalty on the appellants and held that the WhatsApp messages constitute UPSI. The order was challenged before the Securities Appeallate Tribunal (“SAT”) and, while setting aside the order, SAT observed that SEBI in its order did not consider contention of the appellants that the information could be heard on streets in the form of gossips or expert guidance which is also published on platforms like Bloomberg.

The NCLAT held that the demand notice served to Flipkart in Form 3 of  Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2016 did not mention the details of the debt, and that the documents required to prove the existence of such debt are not attached along with demand notice.

State of NCT of Delhi (2023INSC819) considered the question whether the transferee bank in a merger can be fastened with corporate criminal liability for offences committed by the officials of the transferor bank prior to a merger of the two entities. The Court answered in the negative given the specific facts and circumstances of the case.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Background and Decision\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Religare Finvest Limited (RFL) had filed a commercial suit against the erstwhile Laxmi Vilas Bank (LVB) for recovery of a sum of INR 791 crores. Subsequently, in September 2018, RFL also filed a criminal complaint alleging that certain officials of LVB conspired with two companies, RHC Holding Pvt. Ltd and Ranchem Pvt. Ltd, to misappropriate fixed deposits that were furnished by RFL with LVB. Although a chargesheet was filed against some officers of LVB, the banking company itself was not implicated as an accused. In November 2020, due to the unstable financial condition of LVB, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) imposed a moratorium on the bank under section 45(2) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and subsequently effected a compulsory amalgamation of LVB with DBS Bank India Limited under the same legislation. The business of the erstwhile LVB was taken over by DBS under the amalgamation, following which LVB ceased to exist as a legal entity.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Thereafter, in February 2021, a supplementary charge sheet was filed to implicate DBS in the criminal proceedings along with the erstwhile officials of LVB as well as RHC Holding and Ranchem. Aggrieved by this, DBS filed a petition before the Delhi High Court seeking to quash the supplementary charge sheet against it. Since the Delhi High Court refused to oblige its request, DBS filed an appeal before the Supreme Court.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The Supreme Court analyzed the provisions of the scheme of amalgamation. Clause 3(3) provided that any proceedings pending against LVB “shall not abate, be discontinued or be ill [sic] any way prejudicially affected, but shall … be prosecuted and enforced by or against” DBS. However, more significantly, the clause contained a proviso which clarified that any criminal proceeding instituted against an officer or employee of LVB before the appointed date of the amalgamation shall be proceeded against such person under law as if LVB had not been dissolved.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"At the outset, the Supreme Court ruled that the aforementioned clause in the scheme must be interpreted in the backdrop of the context of the scheme of amalgamation, which was essentially to ensure recovery of LVB’s dues (as a result of its financial instability) and for the protection of its creditors. If therefore noted that:\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"“the express mention of directors and such other individuals in the proviso means that it is to that extent only that prosecutions or other criminal proceedings can continue; in the ordinary sense, criminal liability can neither be attributed to DBS nor its directors, brought in after the amalgamation, whose appointments were approved by the RBI.”\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Since the original liability (if proven) was only those of the officials of the erstwhile LVB, the Court asserted that it remained unaffected by the amalgamation of LVB into DBS. Accordingly, it found no involvement of DBS, which is therefore devoid of any liability. The Court’s interpretation also seems heavily driven by the context of the amalgamation in which DBS effectively rescued the business of LVB which had become financially unviable. It also noted that “the public’s confidence in the banking industry was at stake”, and that to “permit prosecution of DBS for the acts of LVB officials … would result in travesty of justice.” In that sense, imposing liability on a successor bank would disincentivise white knights (such as DBS) from rescuing failing banks. Hence, the Supreme Court quashed the criminal proceedings against DBS.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Analysis and Conclusion\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"While the Supreme Court’s conclusion is understandable, the precedential value of the ruling is arguably limited, as it was confined to the specific facts and circumstances of the case. First, this involved a merger of two banks under the Banking Regulation Act rather than any other types of companies, whose merger would typically be governed by the Companies Act, 2013. Under section 242(3)(c) of the Companies Act, “the continuation by or against the transferee company of any legal proceedings pending by or against any transferor company on the date of transfer” would be determined by the order of the National Company Law Tribunal. However, under section 245(5)(e) of the Banking Regulation Act, the scheme of amalgamation prepared by the RBI can provide for the manner in, and extent to, which pending proceedings are continued against the transferee bank. This distinction is somewhat insignificant because, even in the case of non-banking companies, parties can effectively include the terms of dealing with legal proceedings in the scheme document which, if approved, by the tribunal would determine the nature of proceedings continued against the transferee company.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Second, the fact that the LVB-DBS transaction was a compulsory merger rather than a consensual one seems to have mattered considerably. This had a significant bearing on how the Supreme Court interpreted the clauses in the scheme in the light of the concomitant provisions in the Banking Regulation Act. The public interest element involved in saving the depositors of LVB and preserving the credibility of the Indian banking industry militate against imposing fresh liabilities on the rescuer transferee entity. Perhaps a similar analysis may likely be inapplicable in the case of typical consensual merger, whether or two banking entities or other companies.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Third, the timing of the liability matters substantially. In the present case, no criminal proceedings initiated by RFL were pending against LVB at the time the amalgamation came into effect, which was 27 November 2020. The proceedings were only against its officers. Hence, even the main prong of clause 3(3) (discussed earlier) states that only proceedings that are pending as on the appointed date would continue against the transferee bank, i.e., DBS. In the present case, since the supplementary proceedings were initiated against DBS only subsequent to the date of effectiveness of the amalgamation and no proceedings were pending against LVB prior to that date, the Court’s conclusion is somewhat more straightforward. If indeed criminal proceedings were to have been pending at the time of the amalgamation, the outcome may not have been so clearcut.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Finally, the present case involved a criminal proceeding where the burden to impose the liability on a transferee company is justifiably high. However, the scenario may not be altogether similar if the proceedings in question led to civil liability.\"\n",

These cases pertained to criminal proceedings wherein several accused could not be tried together.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The ECJ highlighted that referencing separately prosecuted individuals can be deemed ‘necessary’ only while ascertaining the guilt of those on trial, given the potential violation of the presumption of innocence for co-suspects. This emphasizes the necessity principle, requiring judicial constraint within strict confines solely to establish the culpability of the individual being tried. In this context, judicious language selection during decision formulation is critical. Precision and accuracy are required to avoid potential premature judgment that can jeopardize the fair examination of the third parties.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The Court applied this precedent mutatis mutandis to hybrid settlement cases in competition law proceedings. The assessment of whether the Commission maintained the presumption of innocence for non-settling parties in hybrid settlements must be determined on a case-specific basis, considering distinct reasoning, facts, and circumstances. Similarly, in the HSBC case, the ECJ ruled that the presumption of innocence would be compromised if the authority, lacking a final conviction, explicitly asserts the non-settling party’s involvement. Consequently, the settlement decision should incorporate only information strictly essential regarding the non-settling party.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"To determine such an ‘explicit declaration by the authority’, the ECJ scrutinized whether adequate drafting safeguards were in place to preserve the presumption of innocence for non-settling parties. The Court additionally examined public statements by the Commissioner responsible for competition policy when the order was issued. Ultimately, the ECJ determined that necessary precautions were taken to safeguard the right to a fair trial, leading to the dismissal of action taken by HSBC.\",\n",

References to Scania using terms like ‘amongst others’ were subject to analysis, and the Court determined that these references did not constitute a definitive assertion of the non-settling party’s liability. The Court’s reasoning drew upon Pometon, affirming that the admission of wrongdoing by a settling party does not automatically transform the references made to said party into explicit declarations. Thus, measures are taken against a settlement decision being equated to a verdict under veil for the non-settling party. \",\n",

This bifurcated procedure leads to intricacies as the settling parties are found to have engaged in competition infringement. These intricacies ripple through the effect of such a decision on non-settling parties, both from the perspective of the settlement order and the ensuing standard decision. Consequently, appeals arise from the non-settling parties with the settlement order being perceived as a verdict under veil: the authorities connecting the settlement order of the settling parties with a presumption of guilt for the non-settling parties in the standard procedure. Thus, how the non-settling parties and their conduct is characterized under it and the conduct of the Commission subsequent to such verdict as once a settlement order has been passed, maintaining a strictly impartial attitude of the authorities in the standard procedure can be a difficult task. \",\n",

      "\n",
      "        \"Accordingly, the CCI can contemplate aligning its procedural framework with a unified approach, departing from the staggered EU model. This shall entail a concurrent adjudication of the settlement order and the standard decision, enduring efficiency, and safeguarding non-settling parties from a prejudiced proceeding, as it may be difficult to correctly measure the settling parties’ involvement without considering the non-settling parties.

If not maintained, the quest to resolve the right of fair trial of the non-settling party can impede the effective enforcement of competition law or vice versa. \",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Furthermore, alongside the practice of a concurrent decision or even in the absence of it, the CCI could implement a preliminary strategy of designating separate teams for the bifurcated process.

Being a more moderate and less drastic approach, the CCI can allocate distinct teams to handle the settlement and standard procedures. Although this resolution might need additional allocation of CCI’s resources, it must be deemed imperative to enhance the effectiveness of the hybrid procedure.

      "\n",
      "        \"Over an issue on misconduct in advertising between RPS Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd and KST Infrastructure Private Limited, RPS had sought reference to arbitration. On 2 May 2011, an arbitration award was passed in the favor of RPS. Aggrieved by the award, KST filed a petition under section 34 of the Arbitration Act.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"In the meantime, CIRP was initiated against KST Infrastructure, i.e., the corporate debtor, in respect of its three real estate projects. An application under section 7 of the IBC was admitted by the adjudicating authority on 27 March 2019. Following this, on 11 July 2020, the resolution plan submitted by KST Whispering Heights Residential Welfare Association was approved by the COC by a majority vote of 80.74%.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"On 19 August 2020, RPS had made a notification about its pending claim arising from the arbitral award against KST Infrastructure. However, the interim resolution professional (IRP) declined the claim, citing that the submission deadline was set at 90 days from the commencement of the CIRP, and the applicant had exceeded this timeframe by 287 days, with the COC having already approved the resolution plan. RPS filed an application before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) seeking consideration of its plan on merits.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The NCLT granted the RPS relief on 3 November 2020. The decision was based on three key reasons: firstly, the claim should have been in the corporate debtor’s records; secondly, if those records were unavailable, KST was obliged to obtain and verify them; and finally, since the claim was announced in public newspapers, RPS might not have been aware of it.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Subsequently, the IRP filed an appeal before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) challenging the NCLT’s order. The NCLAT overturned the decision and held that IRP had adhered to regulation 6 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations 2016 and emphasised that RPS had ample opportunity within the mandated timeframe to submit its claim. The NCLAT observed that acceptance of new claims at this stage could potentially jeopardise the resolution plan that had already received the COC’s approval.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Observations of the Supreme Court\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The Supreme Court affirmed the NCLAT’s stance that the IRP had followed the due process for determining the liabilities of the corporate debtor, KST. The Court placed the onus on RPS for failing to recognize the ongoing CIRP and admonished that admitting claims following the COC approval could prolong the CIRP indefinitely.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Significance of the Judgement\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The Court in this judgement has unequivocally emphasised the crucial principle that the IBC is inherently a ‘time-bound process’. RPS’s contention based State Tax Officer v. Rainbow Papers Ltd. was that there should be a provision within the resolution plan to account for contingent claims. Going by this perspective, if the appeal is ultimately dismissed, and the award is finalised, any claim made by RPS not covered under the contingent claim provision would lose its standing.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Nevertheless, it is imperative to recognise that the incorporation of arrangements for contingent claims was unnecessary in this instance, given that the resolution plan had been meticulously crafted based on the information memorandum. Therefore, the Supreme Court’s reliance on the Committee of Creditors of Essar Steel India Limited through Authorised Signatory v. Satish Kumar Gupta, which cautioned against admitting claims subsequent to the COC approving the resolution plan, conforms to the statutory intent of the IBC.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"It is crucial to emphasize that the Supreme Court did not immediately adopt the stance that claims submitted after approval by the COC ‘must not’ be entertained. Instead, it acknowledged the possibility of extending the timeframe under specific circumstances. The Court emphasised that such extensions should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, contingent upon the individual merits of each case. In the present context, the Supreme Court aptly deemed the 287-day delay in filing the claim in the present case as significant delay. Furthermore, the Court judiciously employed the term ‘vigilant’ in asserting that RPS should have exercised vigilance in recognising KST’s insolvency proceedings. This rationale stems from the expectation that RPS should have been aware of KST’s involvement in the CIRP and subsequently should have initiated their claim. The overarching concern is that allowing claims following a resolution plan’s approval could potentially open the door for unfounded claims to disrupt the process.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"It is worth emphasising that while the COC had approved the plan, it was still pending approval from the adjudicating authority. The Supreme Court adopted the position that the fact that the plan was pending approval of the adjudicating authority should not result in a perpetual oscillation, which would effectively transform the CIRP into an unending ordeal. Implicitly, this underscores the Court’s continued respect for the commercial judgment exercised by the COC, upholding the significance of the COC’s approval in the CIRP Process.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Conclusion\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"In a resounding verdict, the Supreme Court has taken a decisive stride towards upholding the time-bound nature of the IBC. In doing so, it has reaffirmed the significance of procedural diligence and the vital role of the IRP. The Court rightly observed that the IRP had meticulously followed the due process in claim collection, thereby placing a critical onus on claimants like RPS Infrastructure to exercise vigilance in their submissions. The glaring delay of 287 days in this case serves as a stark reminder of the potential pitfalls of admitting claims after the approval of the COC, which could indeed open the floodgates to an infinite array of claims, plunging the CIRP into an unending abyss.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"This judgment represents a pivotal milestone in ensuring the seamless and time-bound execution of the CIRP. It sends a strong signal to corporations and individuals to remain vigilant regarding the ongoing CIRP involving their stakeholders. As a result, this ruling stands as a formidable bulwark against the looming spectre of infinite CIRP.\",\n",

However, compliance with regulation 62A could create an additional compliance burden on LCBs, who are already governed by SEBI’s framework for Large Corporate Borrowers.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The LCB framework, at its core, requires LCBs to raise at least 25% of their incremental borrowings through the issuance of debentures. It fosters the corporate bond market’s growth and enhances investor options and protection. However, this framework has a time period of two years, referred to as a block, within which LCBs must fulfil the 25% requirement. Failure to do so incurs a penalty of 0.2% on the shortfall amount, calculated as the difference between actual debenture issuance and the mandated amount. However, several LCBs struggled to fulfil this mandate, due to which SEBI extended the deadline. With regulation 62A coming in, these NCDs issued by LCBs would now have to be listed on stock exchanges if they possess any outstanding listed NCDs. This may increase the administrative and operational burden on the issuer and expose it to greater regulatory risk and liability. The issuer would have to list all NCDs regardless of size, tenure and purpose of issuance, which may limit the flexibility.\",\n",

The HVDLE framework necessitates adherence to corporate governance norms akin to those for equity-listed entities, which would create an additional compliance burden on issuers with unlisted entities.\",\n",

These NCDs are better traded with a commercial understanding between the issuer and the investor, as they can potentially disrupt the market. Listing of low credit-rated debt securities might improve transparency in the market, but they may have a spillover effect of increasing market volatility and risk for investors; hence, such entities should only list their NCDs with proper monitoring from SEBI.\",\n",

Bonus shares, also known as “scrip dividends or capitalization issues,” are additional fully paid up shares that a company issues to its existing shareholders without any cost. These shares are allocated to the shareholders in proportion to their current shareholdings. Bonus shares are typically issued out of the company’s retained earnings or free reserves and do not involve any cash outflow from the company. Instead, they represent a capitalization of profits and are a means for the company to reward its loyal shareholders.\",\n",

This provision starts with a non obstanteclause and provides that the company (listed/unlisted) undertaking capital reduction is liable to pay tax at the rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on the amount of distributed income (hereinafter referred to as the ‘buy-back tax’). The term ‘distributed income’ means the consideration paid by the company on buy-back of shares as reduced by the amount which was received by the company for issue of such shares, determined according to the mechanism provided in the Income Tax Rules, 1962.\",\n",

Prior to this amendment, the term buy-back was defined to mean “purchase by a company of its own shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 77A of the Companies Act, 1956.” However, the Memorandum explaining the Finance Bill 2016 (‘Memorandum’) clarified that the provisions of this section shall apply to any buy-back undertaken by the company in accordance with the provisions of the law relating to the Companies and not necessarily restricted to section 77A of the Companies Act, 1956.\",\n",

In other words, what is relevant is the substance of a transaction involving distribution of income by the company to the shareholders and not the governing section/provision of the Companies Act under which such a transaction/arrangement is undertaken. The Memorandum bringing such amendment itself recognizes that it is possible for a company to undertake purchase of its own shares through means and mode other than buy-back mechanism prescribed under section 77A of the Companies Act, 1956 (or the corresponding section 68 of the Companies Act, 2013). Accordingly, the definition of term “buy-back” under section 115QA of the Act is no longer restricted to only cover a transaction of purchase of its own shares by the company under section 77A of the Companies Act, 1956 (or the corresponding section 68 of the Companies Act, 2013) but any transaction involving purchase of its own shares by the company in accordance with the provisions of Companies Act.\",\n",

Note that the capital reduction process can be carried out along with a scheme of merger/demerger or any compromise or arrangement as the procedure specified in a capital reduction is similar to the one specified for corporate re-arrangements as provided in section 230 to 232 of the Companies Act, 2013.

The notification is in furtherance of India’s obligations under the Cape Town Convention (CTC) and the Aircraft Equipment Protocol to which it acceded in 2008. The CTC establishes a set of minimum guarantees that the acceding countries have provided to the aircraft lessors and includes provisions for a time-bound mechanism to allow lessors to reclaim their aircraft.\",\n",

      "        \"Due to the ongoing insolvency resolution of Go Airlines, this development is seen as a major relief to the aircraft lessors, as this may allow them to reclaim the possession of their leased aircraft that continues to be in the possession of the corporate debtor due to the moratorium granted by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) while admitting the application for corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) under section 10 of the IBC. The primary question raised in SMBC Aviation Capital Ltd v. Interim Resolution Professional of Go Airlines (India) Ltd. of whether the corporate debtor has any legitimate rights or beneficial interests in the aircraft, allowing it to maintain possession during the moratorium as per section 14, remains unsettled.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"This post aims to analyse the rationale of the MCA behind the notification dated 3 October 2023. The implications of this development on the aviation industry and the working of the IBC are discussed. Further, emphasis has been laid on the need for ratification of the CTC and a balanced approach while dealing with insolvencies in the airline sector.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The Rationale\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The Indian Government has taken various policy measures such as Project Rupee Raftaar and the provision of tax benefits to international lessors to attract aircraft leasing and domicile registration of aircraft in India. Due to the insolvency proceedings of several major Indian airlines like Go Airlines, Jet Airways, and Kingfisher Airlines, international lessors are increasingly losing confidence in the Indian market, which is a grave concern since they effectively lose rights provided to them under the lease agreements in relation to their leased aircrafts during the moratorium period. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) de-registered three aircraft of another ailing Indian airline, SpiceJet, at the request of aircraft lessors. This shows worrying signs for the Indian aviation industry as 80 per cent of India’s commercial aircrafts are leased as per PwC.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The CTC provides for an insolvency framework to protect the lessors from across jurisdictions. At the same time, the convention also recognizes the insolvency proceedings in the centre of the main interests. Other features include the 60-days waiting or a moratorium period, prioritisation of creditors with registered international interests, and two alternative approaches to deal with insolvencies involving creditors covered under the convention. It is interesting to note that some of these features are not in tandem with India’s domestic law i.e., the IBC. This can be attributed to the fact that India has acceded to the CTC but has not yet ratified it, although the Government had attempted to ratify the convention by introducing Cape Town Convention Bill in 2018, although it could not be passed in the Parliament.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The notification exempting the aircraft industry from the application of a moratorium under section 14(1) of the IBC can be seen as India’s first step towards honouring its commitment under the CTC, thereby alleviating the concerns of aircraft lessors, and boosting their confidence in the Indian market.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Implications and Concerns\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The MCA has exempted the aviation industry from the moratorium clause by exercising its power under section 14(3) of the IBC which empowers the Central Government to exempt any transactions, agreements, or any other arrangements. It is pertinent to note that the CTC has not been ratified by the Parliament. This situation poses twin challenges to the resolution process of airline companies.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"First, this renders the IBC toothless in insolvency matters relating to the aviation industry. The Supreme Court in Sundaresh Bhatt, Liquidator of ABG Shipyard v. Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs observed that the objective of the moratorium is to keep the assets of the corporate debtor together during CIRP to facilitate the orderly completion of the processes envisaged under the IBC. Without a moratorium on the assets of a corporate debtor, particularly aircraft, it becomes exceedingly difficult to sustain an airline undergoing insolvency proceedings as a going concern. Nevertheless, the tribunal might still be able to categorize the aircraft as essential goods or services under section 14(2) of the IBC.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Secondly, the insolvency framework outlined in the CTC cannot be implemented unless the convention receives ratification from the Parliament since the convention cannot be made applicable unless it is accommodated in the municipal laws, especially when treaty obligations require alterations to domestic laws. This position was established by the Supreme Court in Jolly Verghese v. Bank of Cochin. In the present case, the provisions of the convention and the IBC are not in tandem with each other which renders ratification necessary. Consequently, the resolution process for airline companies becomes extremely complex whether it is carried out through the insolvency framework provided under the CTC or by the mechanism for resolution provided under the IBC.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Moreover, the notification is being touted as a major relief for the aircraft lessors in the Go Airlines insolvency proceedings, although the lessors might not be able to claim exemption from the moratorium clause under section 14(1) of the IBC since the notification does not provide for retrospective application.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Way Forward\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The exemption of the aviation industry from the moratorium clause provided under the IBC in terms of the MCA notification is in accordance with India’s obligations under the CTC. It seeks to boost the confidence of aircraft lessors in the Indian market, which has wavered due to the bankruptcy of major Indian airlines.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Nonetheless, the absence of ratification of the CTC by the Parliament presents various challenges. The convention’s provisions, while beneficial, do not align seamlessly with India’s domestic insolvency legislation i.e., the IBC. Consequently, the IBC’s effectiveness in handling aviation sector insolvencies remains uncertain in light of the recent notification. Without a moratorium on a corporate debtor’s assets, notably aircraft, maintaining the viability of airline companies during insolvency proceedings becomes problematic.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"To address these complexities, a balanced approach is crucial when dealing with airline sector insolvencies. The protection of the rights of the aircraft lessors must not be at the expense of keeping distressed airline companies as a going concern. Emphasis on the need for ratification of the CTC by the Parliament is essential to harmonize international obligations with domestic laws. This would enhance the stability of the aviation industry, attract international lessors, and facilitate smoother insolvency resolution processes for financially distressed airlines.\",\n",

Input tax credit (ITC) under GST is one such core concept that furthers this objective. ITC is the tax that a business pays on a purchase, and when it makes the sale, it can reduce its tax liability. ITC helps businesses reduce their tax liability on purchases by claiming credit to the extent of GST. ITC is the cornerstone of GST and can be claimed regardless of the location of the seller, making sales and purchases of products more accessible.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"However, section 16 of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (“CGST Act”) lists certain requirements that have to be fulfilled by a business in order to claim ITC. One such condition provided in section 16(2)(c) of the CGST Act is that the tax charged in respect of the supply of goods must be actually paid to the government by the supplier. Thus, a claimant would be entitled to ITC only when, inter alia, the tax on supply has been paid to the government. Placing such a burden on the claimant is arbitrary and impractical as it is impossible for a claimant to determine whether or not the supplier has remitted the tax to the government. In case of default, the claimant will not only be denied ITC but also will face the additional burden of furnishing reverse ITC along with interest to the government. Such a provision clearly discriminates between bona fide claimants and fraudulent claimants of ITC.\",\n",

The author argues that the said ruling is problematic and incorrect as it denies the benefit of ITC to bona fide claimants. The author supports his argument by analyzing the said ruling in light of judicial pronouncements on the issue in the pre-GST regime as well GST regime.\",\n",

      "        \"In the present case, Pinstar Automotive India Pvt. Ltd (petitioner) was an assessee under the CGST Act and had received a pre-assessment notice from the respondent in regard to the issue relating to the invocation of section 16(2)(c). The petitioner stated that it had received certain supplies from three third parties – Techno Rubber Plastic and Co., Techno Rubber and Plastic, and Unique Autoplastics Private Limited and that it had paid the entirety of the amount including the tax to them. However, it was found that the suppliers had not filed GSTR 3B and no tax was remitted to the department, as a consequence of which the petitioner suffered a reversal of ITC. The petitioner argued that it was entitled to ITC as it had fulfilled all the conditions under the statute and had also adduced proof of the same. However, the stand of the petitioner was rejected unilaterally by the respondent who passed an order confirming the demand proposed in the pre-assessment notice. Aggrieved by this order, the petitioner moved the High Court seeking rectification of errors apparent on the face of the record under section 161 of the CGST Act.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Having heard both parties, the Court ruled that the requirements laid down in section 16 of the CGST Act to claim ITC need to be interpreted strictly to ensure that the interests of the revenue are not jeopardized. It observed (at para 9):“The provisions of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 has, assimilating wisdom of experience from the erstwhile tax regimes, gone one step further to ensure that the interests of the revenue are protected by providing for a mandate that the tax liability is defrayed/met either at the hands of the supplier or the purchaser, the petitioner in this case.” Thus, the Court ruled that it was not the department’s fault that the suppliers in the present case failed to remit the tax to the department. Instead, the onus is on the supplier or purchaser to ensure compliance with section 16 without which they would not be entitled to ITC.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Analysis of the Issue\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The heart of the controversy revolves around the interpretation of section 16(2)(c) of the CGST Act, which states that a recipient is eligible for ITC only if the tax levied on the supply of goods has been deposited with the government by the supplier. The bare provision of section 16(2)(c) of the CGST Act reads:\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"“Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, no registered person shall be entitled to the credit of any input tax in respect of any supply of goods or services or both to him unless, ––\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"subject to the provisions of section 41 or section 43A, the tax charged in respect of such supply has been actually paid to the Government, either in cash or through the utilization of input tax credit admissible in respect of the said supply;” [emphasis added]\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The provision becomes troublesome if the words “has been actually paid to the Government” is interpreted to mean that it is the duty of the recipient to ensure that the tax paid by them on goods supplied by the supplier is actually transferred to the purse of the government by the supplier. This means that an additional burden will be placed on the claimant to cross-check whether the supplier has paid the tax to the government failing which, the claimant would not be entitled to ITC under the law. This risks the position of a bona fide purchaser who is precluded from claiming ITC even when the default occurs on the part of the supplier and not the claimant as is the case in the present matter. It is pertinent to note that this issue is not an alien one and was a highly debated issue even in the pre-GST regime. The jurisprudential position surrounding this issue can be understood from the following judicial decisions.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"In a significant ruling in 2013, the Supreme Court in Commissioner of Central Excise, Jalandhar v. Kay Kay Industries, while allowing the recipient (respondent) to claim MODVAT credit even when the supplier had defaulted in his duty to pay tax received from the recipient on inputs to the department, held that “an assessee is not expected to verify with Department whether the supplier had paid duty on inputs or not supplied by Manufacturer-Supplier in order to avail deemed MODVAT credit.”  The Court further observed that where the assessee has followed the prescribed procedure, it would be unjustifiable and impractical to impose such a condition and would instead lead to transactions getting delayed. In the same year, the Delhi CESTAT in the case of CC & CCE v. Juhi Alloys Ltd  held: “A buyer can take steps that are in their control and he cannot be expected to verify the records of the supplier’s broker (i.e. dealer) to check whether, in fact, the supplier has paid duty on the goods supplied by him or not. Hence, as long as the bonafide nature of the consignee transaction is not doubted, credit should not be denied to the buyer.” A similar view was taken by the Jharkhand High Court in Commissioner of C. Ex., East Singhbhum v. Tata Motors Ltd., and by a Division Bench of Himachal Pradesh High Court in A.B. Tools Limited v. Commissioner of Central Excise.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Further, the ruling of Delhi High Court in Arise India Ltd. v. Commissioner of Tax is relevant to the discussion at hand. The issue involved in the case was a clause in the Delhi Value Added Tax Act (“DVAT Act”), section 9(2)(g), which is identical to section 16(2)(c) of the CGST Act. Section 9(2)(g) of the DVAT Act states:\",\n",

      "\n",
      "        \"The High Court, while striking down the above provision, observed that the DVAT Act does not create an intelligible distinction between bona fide purchasing dealers vis-à-vis fraudulent dealers which renders this provision invalid in terms of Article 14 of the Constitution. The Court was of view that such a provision casts an undue responsibility on the purchaser to verify whether the tax is paid by the seller to the government and also denies ITC to a purchaser even if the transaction is bona fide. Further, the Court said that in case the seller fails to deposit the tax, the authorities should move against the seller first and not the buyer for recovery of tax. This ruling was later upheld by the Supreme Court as well.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Coming to the new GST regime, one can observe a similar set of judicial decisions. For instance, the Madras High Court in M/s D.Y. Beathel Enterprises v. the State Tax Officer, the Court while allowing the recipient to claim ITC observed that strict action must be taken against a seller who due to omission on his part fails to remit the tax paid by the recipient. Similarly, in  Assistant Commissioner (CT), presently Thiruverkadu Assessment Circle, Kolathur, Chennai v. Infiniti Wholesale Ltd., the Madras High Court held that where the purchaser has proved that it has paid the due tax to the seller and furnishes the invoices for the same, it cannot be stopped from availing the ITC. The Court added that such a restriction on claiming ITC cannot be sustained and requires re-consideration.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Thus, from a plain reading of the above rulings of various High Courts in the pre-GST as well as GST regime, it can be inferred that the courts have ruled in favour of bona fide purchasers and allowed them to avail ITC even when their supplier had defaulted in remitting the tax to the kitty of the government. The courts took cognizance of the actions of authorities denying ITC to businesses where the seller has not deposited the tax and declared such conditions in the law as unfair, arbitrary, and inimical to business interests. The courts have clearly noted that it is impractical and unrealistic to expect the buyer of supplies to go and verify the supplier’s accounts or to inquire with the department whether the tax paid by them on the inputs has been collected or not.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"On the issue of reversal of ITC and recovery of dues from buyers, it is useful to refer to the Press Release issued by the Central Board of GST Council dated 4 May 2018 which clearly stated that in case where the supplier defaults in payment of tax, there shall not be any automatic reversal of input tax credit to the buyer unless an exceptional case can be made out. Instead, the recovery shall be made from the supplier first. The Government’s intention behind ITC has further clarified in the 28th GST Council Meeting  where it recommended that recovery of unpaid tax be done from the defaulting supplier. Thus, in the present case, the petitioner was wrongfully denied ITC and instead charged with reversal of ITC and interest for no fault on its part.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Way Forward \",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"It is ostensible that section 16(2)(c) of CGST Act 2017 in its present form is susceptible to an interpretation that imposes a duty on the recipient to crosscheck whether GST has been remitted by the supplier to the government for the invoice on which ITC has been collected from the recipient. However, under the current GST mechanism, it is an uphill task for businesses to determine whether or not the supplier has filed the tax to the government. This places businesses in a precarious situation where they are expected to determine whether the intentions of the suppliers are opportune or not. Adding to the woes of the businesses is the provision of reversal of ITC along with interest which clearly goes against the spirit of GST to facilitate ease of doing of businesses in the nation. Hence, it is imperative that the government seriously reconsider the above provisions and bring about a corresponding amendment in the GST law to eradicate the hardship faced by the recipients in claiming ITC. Further, there should be a mechanism set up to track payment by supplier against a particular invoice to avoid any undue hardships on recipients. Until then, it is expected that the judiciary take steps to ensure that ITC is not denied to bona fide purchasers.\",\n",

Currently, data is scattered among a number of platforms, each of which performs a different function. The web portal of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs stores financial data and compliance records; the web portal of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) administers case status and online orders; and the webportal of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) serves as a regulator’s data repository. Procedures are handled individually in respect of each of the bodies, and for debt and creditor information, IPA/Valuer Portals and National E-Governance Services Limited (NeSL) are used. Although each of these platforms has a special function, they are not integrated, which causes inefficiencies and delays in the insolvency process. The insolvency procedure is currently experiencing inefficiencies and delays due to a lack of platform interoperability. In this post, the authors have delved into the importance of consolidating IBC-related data into a single, unified platform and explored the potential benefits of such a move.\",\n",

      "        \"Information Utilities: Accelerating Insolvency Resolution with Data Integrity\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"In the insolvency of Go Airlines, the Information Utility (IU) system demonstrated its remarkable efficiency. The IBBI effortlessly transferred case-related information to the NeSL via an API before the NCLT officially acknowledged the start of the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP). All of the corporate debtor’s bankers subsequently received emails alerting them to the imminent insolvency procedure. This demonstrates the crucial role IUs play in expediting the CIRP.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The CIRP, which is governed by section 12 of the IBC, has a strict deadline of 330 days for completion that places an emphasis on efficiency. The ambitious CIRP timeline is based on the idea that all participants will have easy access to data pertinent to the process. The idea of IUs as envisioned by the IBC serves as the foundation for this confidence. IUs must be prepared to deliver all relevant information promptly in order to adhere to the rigid IBC timeframe. To fulfill these deadlines, it is imperative that all parties, including creditors, adjudicating authorities, and insolvency resolution professionals, have quick access to pertinent information. IUs play a crucial role in speeding the CIRP timeline by acting as an essential repository of verified data about debt and defaults.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"IUs also support insolvency professionals throughout the CIRP. All financial creditors are required by the IBC to provide the IU with information. In 2017, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued directives to banks, non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), and asset reconstruction firms (ARCs) to ensure legal compliance. As a result, the IU keeps almost all of the information provided by corporate entities and creditors. Insolvency professionals can access the IU to examine the information with claims submitted by creditors after the general announcement, streamlining the claims verification procedure. An important step in accelerating the process of authenticating and verifying data regarding debtor default in insolvency cases was taken by the IBBI circular dated September 7, 2019. In order to expedite the debtor default verification procedure, it has reinforced the function of IUs by enabling them to retrieve the data from the Central Registry of Securitization Asset Reconstruction and Security Interest (CERSAI) portal. For the objective of registering security interests created on movable and intangible assets, such as accounts receivable, book debts, and hypothecation, as well as to begin registering all other kinds of mortgages used in India, CERSAI is a central online security interest registry established under the provisions of Chapter IV of the SARFAESI Act.\",\n",

      "\n",
      "        \"The present system suffers from data duplication, disparate structures, and limited processability. To overcome these challenges, integrating data across various systems into a comprehensive IT framework for IBC processes is essential. Such integration offers numerous advantages, including a single source of truth throughout the insolvency process, real-time dashboards for data-driven decision-making, prioritization of security and privacy by design, maintenance of audit trails for transparency, and efficiency gains through streamlined data management.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"To address these challenges, it is imperative to streamline and centralize the data. Leveraging the MCA-21 database, a vital resource, can aid in the early identification of companies at risk of insolvency. The MCA launched an e-government programme called MCA21 which allows business organizations, employees, and Indian residents to easily and securely access MCA services. It provides essential data points, such as financial ratios, operational indicators, audit qualifications, and compliance issues, which are invaluable for proactively detecting companies in financial distress. Additionally, the MCA21 database can help identify sectors and industries prone to financial stress, using factors like insolvency numbers, debt levels, resolution times, and recovery rates, enabling policymakers to formulate sector-specific interventions.\",\n",

It assesses a company’s ability to continue as a going concern, the quality of internal controls and financial reporting, and compliance status, all of which guide policymakers in addressing financial stress. Data from NCLT and IBBI can be used to review IBC process outcomes, identify bottlenecks, analyze delays, and address stakeholder-specific issues. Moreover, examining post-insolvency resolution data, including production, revenue, bank financing, capital investments, and credit appraisal insights, aids in evaluating the effectiveness of the insolvency process and contributes to orderly credit growth in the economy.\",\n",

      "        \"A data-driven approach is fundamental for shaping effective insolvency law and enacting meaningful reforms within the insolvency landscape. To combat the existing challenge of scattered information sources across the IBC framework, a unified platform is imperative. This platform should be designed as a comprehensive IT framework for all IBC processes, providing seamless access to critical data. Data accessibility, analysis, and security can all be improved by utilizing cutting-edge technology such as blockchain, AI, big data analytics, and the Internet of Things.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"In addition to technological advancements, state-level investments in data collection systems are crucial. States can establish these systems by building upon existing infrastructure, creating a sophisticated mechanism for collecting insolvency-related data. A pivotal initial step in this process involves assessing the wealth of information sources already available, including general insolvency statistics, judicial data, and statistics provided by insolvency regulators and other relevant authorities. For instance, the MCA21 database presents a valuable resource for policymakers. This database can be harnessed to establish early warning systems based on various financial indicators, operational metrics, audit qualifications, and compliance records. These proactive systems enable the identification of companies at risk of insolvency well in advance. Additionally, by utilizing MCA21 data, policymakers can identify specific sectors and industries that are susceptible to financial stress, facilitating the formulation of tailored policy interventions. These interventions can address critical factors like insolvency rates, debt burdens, resolution timelines, and recovery rates.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Furthermore, the foundation of sound insolvency policies relies on the collection and thorough analysis of empirical data. This approach ensures that legislative changes are precisely tailored to resolve particular problems within the insolvency framework. Regular compilation and analysis of data offer valuable insights that inform the design of reforms and gauge their effectiveness. This iterative process creates a feedback loop, reinforcing the impact of legislative interventions. In an era characterized by the prominence of big data, policymaking in the absence of empirical data must be avoided to prevent inefficiencies and potential adverse consequences.\",\n",

      "        \"Conclusion \",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The role of information as a crucial utility in CIRP cannot be overstated. The expeditious resolution of insolvency cases, particularly within the mandated 330-day timeline, is heavily reliant on the availability and accessibility of comprehensive information. When all relevant data and documents are conveniently aggregated in one central repository, it empowers resolution professionals with the essential tools needed to navigate complex insolvency proceedings efficiently. The centralized information hub will serve as a vital resource, providing resolution professionals with a holistic view of the distressed entity’s financial history, assets, liabilities, contracts, and operational intricacies. Such a comprehensive repository not only streamlines decision-making but also significantly reduces the time and effort required to gather scattered information from various sources. Armed with a comprehensive information pool, they can make informed decisions promptly, engage stakeholders more efficiently, and ultimately expedite the resolution process. This, in turn, aligns with the overarching goal of the insolvency framework – to maximize value for creditors and stakeholders while ensuring timely closure of insolvency cases.\",\n",

Blue Coast Hotels Ltd. & Ors clarified that section 13(3A) of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act, 2002 (the “Act”) is not merely directory, but in fact mandatory in nature. The Court further stated that in the event a security interest has been created on agricultural land that is not intended to be used for the purpose of agriculture, then such security interest can be enforced by the creditor under the provisions of the Act.\",\n",

(“debtor”) which included the creation of a special mortgage comprising of the debtor’s hotel property, including the agricultural land on which the debtor intended to develop villas. The debtor defaulted in repaying the loan amount and subsequently its account was classified as a non-performing asset (NPA). Notices issued calling for repayment went unheeded by the debtor, which prompted the creditor to issue a notice under section 13(2) of the Act. The debtor in reply presented a rescheduled plan for repaying the loan as provided under section 13(3A) of the Act; however, this never materialised and instead the debtor used a number of delaying tactics to prolong repayment of the outstanding amount. The creditor took symbolic possession of the property as permitted under section 13(4) of the Act and subsequently held a public auction, three of which failed to attract any bids, and the fourth auction led to the acquisition of the property by ITC Ltd.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Procedural History \",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Initially, the debtor approached the Debt Recovery Tribunal (“DRT”) against the creditor’s symbolic possession of the property and its subsequent intent to auction the same. After negotiations between the creditor and the debtor did not yield any positive results and the creditor issued a second notice of auction, the DRT passed an interim order directing the creditor to defer the acceptance of bids and not to take any further steps for the sale of the property. The creditor challenged this interim order passed by the DRT before the Debts Recovery Appellate Tribunal (“DRAT”) which in turn directed the DRT to dispose the second appeal within a month.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The DRT disposed off the second appeal and set aside the notice issued under section 13(2) on the grounds that the creditor did not comply with the provision laid down in section 13(3A) and issued a demand notice jointly for the mortgaged land comprising of the agricultural land, which is protected from the enforcement of security interest as provided under section 31(i) of the Act.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The creditor approached the DRAT which upheld the issuance of notice under section 13(2) of the Act and set aside the order passed by the DRT.\",\n",

      "\n",
      "        \"The High Court in its ruling set aside the order of the DRAT, holding that the creditor failed to acknowledge the representations of the debtor and thus did not act in accordance with the provision contained in section 13(3A) of the Act. Also, going by the strict interpretation of the statute laid down in section 31(i), the High Court held that no security interest could be enforced on agricultural land which has been mortgaged. The High Court also held that it was incumbent on the creditor to take actual physical possession of the property before proceeding with the auction and that the said auction was vitiated due to fraud and collusion.\",\n",

      "\n",
      "        \"Analysis \",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"In dealing with the first issue, it is important to revisit the Supreme Court’s decision in Mardia Chemicals Ltd. v. Union of India  wherein a three-judge bench clarified that, on receipt of a notice, the borrower can reply stating its objections and that the lender should reply to the borrower, giving its reasons so as to either accept or reject the objections that have been raised by the borrower. This directive of the Supreme Court was subsequently embedded in section 13(3A) of the Act which was inserted by Parliament by way of an amendment. It is critical to analyse the intent of the legislature in adding this provision. Section 13(3A) states that a borrower, on receipt of a notice issued under section 13(2) may raise an objection against the proposed measure or make a representation of any nature, explaining the circumstances revolving around its inability to repay the debt and propose rescheduling the repayment. The creditor must consider and, if not found acceptable, may reject the same after giving sufficient reasons for doing so before proceeding with action mandated under section 13(4) of the Act.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Initially, the Act did not provide for any representation on part of the borrower in the event a notice was issued under section 13(2). The amendment was brought about by Parliament following the decision of the Supreme Court in Mardia Chemicals. The intent of the legislature was clear to provide the borrower a chance to give its representations or objections to the demand notice issued by the creditor. The onus is then placed on the creditor to either accept or reject the contentions of the debtor by giving adequate reasons for its decision. The Supreme Court was of the view that in the event that any provision deals with providing reasons for consideration, then such provisions should be treated as mandatory and not merely directory.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Furthermore, the Supreme Court agreed with the view laid down in Transcore v. Union of India wherein it did not distinguish between actual or symbolic possession of the secured assets by the secured creditor in pursuance of enforcing security interest.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"In the present case, whilst the creditor did not furnish any reasons for rejecting the debtor’s representations for rescheduling the repayment of the debt, it is key to note that communication between the two parties induced the creditor, through assurances and promises, not to take action against the debtor. Moreover, negotiations were even entered upon for settling the pending dues and the creditor even accepted six cheques in repayment (which were ultimately dishonoured) much after the notice issued under section 13(2) and a reply of the debtor’s representations. The creditor had given many opportunities to repay the debt; however, the debtor kept seeking more time. It is pertinent to note that the debtor even executed a ‘Letter of Undertaking’ acknowledging the right of the creditor to sell the assets in the event of default.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The intent of the legislature in enacting section 13(3A) was to remedy the lacuna in the law so as to ensure that the debtor is still given a chance to repay its debt on the contingency that its objections and representations are entertained (or not) by the creditor with sufficient reasons. However, given the facts of this case, the Supreme Court has gone beyond the plain reading of the statute and was of the view that despite being given several occasions for repaying the debt, the debtor has yet failed to do so, thus ruling in favour of the appellants.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"On the second issue, the High Court went by the literal meaning of the law laid down under section 31(i) and held that the inclusion of agricultural land for the purpose of creating a security interest cannot be held to be valid. However, the Supreme Court elaborated the scope of this section beyond its literal meaning. The intention of Parliament to enact this provision was to protect agricultural land held by agriculturalists for the purpose of cultivation as well as protect their income and livelihood; hence the same was exempted from the provisions of the Act. In the present case, however, the debtor purchased several parcels of land, some of which were agricultural in nature with the intent of building a five-star hotel. Whilst the land purchased by the debtor directly from the agriculturalists were entered as agricultural lands in the revenue records, the debtor had applied to the revenue authorities for the conversion of the concerned land to non-agricultural land, which is yet pending approval.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"In addition, whilst no security interest can be created on agricultural lands as explicitly stated under section 31(i) of the Act, and yet a mortgage was created showing that the parties never intended to treat the same as agricultural land. Also, it is pertinent to note that no substantial cultivation was taking place on the area and in fact the debtor had intended to develop villas on the agricultural land.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The debtors even went on to challenge to validity of Parliament’s legislative competence to enact this provision, considering the scope of  agricultural land falls within the ambit of the Entry 18 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution. However, the Supreme Court negated this contention by citing a precedent laid down in Union of India v. Delhi High Court Bar Association and Ors wherein it was held that this provision of the Act would wall within the scope of Entry 45 List I dealing with banking, which includes recovery of debts due to banks within its scope.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"As far as the third issue is concerned, the Supreme Court did not agree with the High Court’s view that the Act did not contemplate the taking over of the symbolic possession and hence the creditors would be restrained from transferring the secured assets to the auction purchaser. It is important to highlight section 13(6) of the Act which states that any transfer of the secured asset after taking possession thereof or takeover of the management under sub-section (4) of section 13 by the secured creditor or by the manager of the secured creditor shall vest in the transferee all the rights as if the transfer had been made by the owner of the secured asset. Harmoniously constructing provisions of the Act along with section 8 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, the Supreme Court stated that the transfer of the secured asset cannot be construed as a complete transfer considering the creditor only had symbolic possession; however, the creditor nevertheless had a right to take actual possession of the secured assets and must therefore be held to be a secured creditor even after a limited transfer to the auction purchaser, as the creditor’s interest has not been entirely transferred, thus permitting the creditor to act in accordance with section 14 of the Act.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Conclusion \",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"This ruling has now clarified the position with regards to section 13(3A) of the Act, with the Supreme Court holding that this provision is not directory but in fact, mandatory in nature. Furthermore, it also held that in the event a security interest is created over an agricultural land which is not intended to be used for agricultural purposes, then the creditor is not barred by section 31 (i) of the Act for enforcing the security interest that has been created on the asset. It is indeed remarkable that the Supreme Court has taken the effort to go beyond the literal meaning of the statute so as to ensure that the debtor does not evade its responsibility as far as repaying its debts are concerned.\",\n",

      "        \"Recently, the American Federal Trade Commission (‘FTC’) sued Amazon alleging that its practices unlawfully maintained its monopoly. The complaint was based on two main grounds – first, the algorithmic processes used by Amazon to curate its search results penalise the retailers who offer lower prices in other platforms by hiding their products in search results; and second, by coercing retailers into availing Amazon’s expensive fulfilment services for obtaining ‘Prime’ eligibility.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"In this post, I limit my analysis to the first ground called ‘anti-discounting’ by the FTC. Using the background of FTC’s action against Amazon in the United States (‘US’), I argue that the Indian competition law does not adequately safeguard against Amazon’s anti-discounting measures. This gap, I conclude, can be remedied by incorporating the Neo-Brandeisian undercurrents of the FTC complaint. To make this argument, firstly, I briefly break down the reasoning in the FTC’s complaint. Secondly, I contextualise anti-discounting in India by analogising it with ‘price parity clauses’.  Lastly, through a perusal of case law, I argue that the Indian Competition Act (‘the Act’) and its jurisprudence inadequately account for such anti-competitive behaviour. Such legal gaps, I submit, should be filled by incorporating the Neo-Brandeisian undercurrents of the FTC complaint. Put simply, the Neo-Brandeisians argue that competition law and policy must widen its focus (from prices, efficiency, and consumer welfare) to become more structure-oriented to prevent any form of monopolistic market concentration.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The Main Findings of the FTC\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Anti-discounting, according to the FTC complaint, refers to the strategy of penalising retailers who charge lower prices in other online marketplace platforms. The FTC notes that despite similar practices (such as price parity clauses) being discarded, Amazon effectively undertakes anti-discounting using algorithms. Per the FTC, Amazon’s Project Nessie algorithm ensures that a seller’s product is pushed towards the end of the search results if the algorithm detects lower pricing by such seller elsewhere. This makes such retailer’s products virtually hidden for majority of consumers who do not go beyond the first few search pages. By disincentivising retailers from charging lower prices elsewhere, the algorithm maintains the perception that Amazon offers lower prices than its e-commerce competitors. Consequently, the rivals of Amazon are unable to undercut the prices charged by it and the prices are not reflective of the market clearing price in competitive markets (see paragraphs 326-332 of the complaint).\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The second malpractice alleged is that Amazon has mandated the subscription of Amazon’s Fulfillment (or transportation) services (‘Fulfilled By Amazon’ or ‘FBA’) for any seller in order to be ‘Prime’ eligible. The FTC stresses that, for a retailer, ‘Prime’ eligibility is necessary to access Amazon’s large customer base of ‘Prime’ members. In this regard, the data adduced by the FTC shows that large numbers of retailers who had forgone FBA ended up being wiped out from the storefront (see paragraphs 358-360 of the complaint). This practice had the anti-competitive effect of restricting market access for those retailers who did not opt for the costly services of FBA. Additionally, it raised the operating costs of the retailers who had no option but to opt in for FBA (see paragraphs 364-367), and harmed other competitors in the market for online retail fulfilment services (see paragraphs 375, 387-394). Cumulatively, anti-discounting and mandatory requirement of FBA for ‘Prime’ eligibility have worked to entrench Amazon’s monopoly power in two relevant markets – the market for online superstores and online marketplace services (see paragraphs 410-415).\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Contextualising FTC’s Findings in the Light of Competition Act, 2002 in India\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Similar to anti-discounting, online platforms earlier used ‘price parity clauses’ in their contracts with every retailer. ‘Price parity clauses’ contractually restrict the retailers from offering lower prices in competing platforms. Such clauses are shown to have anti-competitive effects (see here and here) because they act as entry barriers for other low-cost entrants in the e-commerce market. They also distort the prices across platforms, adversely impacting competition and reifying the dominant position of the certain marketplace entities. Such clauses have been banned in several jurisdictions. Illustratively, Article 5.3 of the EU’s Digital Markets Act prohibits a ‘gatekeeper platform’ from preventing its ‘business users’ from charging lower prices at other platforms.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"In the Indian context, price parity clauses were flagged for the first time by the 2020 Market Study on E-Commerce (see paragraph 93) by the Competition Commission of India (‘CCI’). Later, in Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Associations of India v. MakeMyTrip India Pvt. Ltd. (‘MMT case’), the CCI penalised OYO and MMT-Go for using anti-competitive price parity clauses in their business agreements with hotel partners. However, it exempted a class of parity clauses – called narrow price parity clauses. Such narrow parity clauses restrict lower pricing only on the retailer’s own website and not in other online marketplace platforms. Under the test laid down in the MMT case, one must undertake a comparative assessment of the pro-competitive and anti-competitive effects of a strategy that ensures price parity. On such analysis, if the pro-competitive effects of narrow parity clauses exceed its anti-competitive effects, then they are deemed justifiable on grounds of market efficiency (MMT case, paragraph 265). However, this reasoning ignores that the anti-competitive effects of price parity strategies are mostly producer-centric whereas its pro-competitive effects are predominantly consumer-centric.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"In the Indian context, price parity clauses would be governed by section 3 of the Act. For instance, the MMT case’s reasoning hinged on the presence of an agreement for price parity (in paragraphs 235, 291). Interestingly, as alleged by the complaint in FTC v. Amazon, anti-discounting price parity is not contractual but algorithmic, excluding the application of section 3. Even if we assume that there existed an agreement/arrangement/understanding between Amazon and the sellers regarding price parity, the causation and motive for anti-discounting would be extremely difficult to explain if Project Nessie employs inductive and deep learning AI systems.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"If a section 3 enquiry is precluded by the absence of any agreement, the only safeguard against anti-discounting is section 4(2) of the Act. First of all, section 4 requires Amazon to be in a “dominant position” – a requirement that is negated by the existing precedents. In Lifestyle Equities v. Amazon Seller Services Pvt. Ltd. (paragraph 23), Amazon was held to be not in a dominant position. Nonetheless, Lifestyle Equities dealt with a more restricted relevant market, namely, the “market for services provided by online platforms for selling fashion merchandise in India.” In contrast, in the FTC complaint, the relevant markets was more widely defined as “markets for online superstores and online marketplace services” (see paragraph 24 of the FTC complaint). However, even with respect to the e-commerce market, in All India Online Vendors Association v. Flipkart, the contention alleging Flipkart’s dominant position was rejected, despite its market share in the e-commerce industry being around 50%. As observed in Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh v. Flipkart and Amazon (in paragraphs 10,15), Amazon owns a much smaller market share compared to Flipkart, and there exists no joint dominance by both.

      "        \"In the Indian context, going by the standard applied in the MMT case, a comparative assessment of the anti-competitive and the pro-competitive effects of such strategy would have to be undertaken. Even in Matrimony,com v. Google LLC (at paragraphs 437-440), where search bias was penalised by the CCI, the analysis rested on a trade-off between pro-competitive and anti-competitive effects of Google’s actions. This standard of search bias in Matrimony.com can be applied to Amazon since anti-discounting also perpetuates a form of search bias. However, this still leaves ample scope for condoning anti-discounting behaviour if its pro-competitive effects, which are mostly consumer-centric, exceed the anti-competitive effects on sellers and other online e-commerce platforms. Moreover, according to Sanwar Mal Agarwal v. Punjab National Bank, the standard for proving abuse of dominant position is a high and onerous burden. As noted earlier, the algorithmic nature of Amazon’s anti-discounting is more difficult to prove due to the ‘black box’ problem, or the inherent difficulty in explaining the internal functioning and motives of AI systems. This further weakens the potential for a section 4 remedy to anti-discounting.\",\n",

      "\n",
      "        \"As mentioned earlier, the Neo-Brandeisian economists view monopoly and market concentration as detrimental in the long run. The Neo-Brandeisians focus on the structures and processes of market competition and not its outcomes (such as efficiency, pricing, and consumer welfare). Consequently, they are also averse to a consumer welfare view of competition law, since several monopolistic structures (such as predatory pricing) may benefit consumers greatly yet have an adverse impact on sellers. Thus, a Neo-Brandeisian view of antitrust law would view arrangements (such as anti-discounting) that seek to eliminate price competition as unlawful.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"According to Lina Khan, the current FTC chairperson, antitrust regulation of the e-commerce industry is better suited to a Neo-Brandeisian outlook due to two reasons: first, platforms such as Amazon prioritise growth over profits; and second, such online marketplaces function as critical market intermediaries. Due to these reasons, the current view of competition laws, exemplified by the insufficiency of the Indian Competition Act in accounting for algorithmic anti-discounting, risks downplaying the long-term risks of market concentration. As a course correction, the Act and its jurisprudence must, apart from comparing the pro-competitive and anti-competitive effects of anti-discounting and price parity arrangements, outlaw such market practices and structures for being per se frustrative of market competition and competitive pricing. This Neo-Brandeisian view also aligns better with the studies that show the dangers of allowing even narrow price parity, despite the fact that their pro-competitive effects may seem to be greater than the anti-competitive effects.\",\n",

The primary objective of the Regulation is to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework that governs the operations of the ESG rating agencies in India. The Regulation, inter-alia, attempts to set out rules regarding the registration of ESG rating agencies, their code of conduct, the process of ESG rating, and imposes disclosure obligations. This article focuses on the ESG rating agencies as specified in the Regulation and analyse the SEBI’s approach in regulating the same.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"SEBI’s Position in the Consultation Paper \",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Prior to the notification of the Regulation, SEBI released a consultation paper on ESG Rating Providers for Securities Markets to understand the concerns related to the unregulated ESG rating agencies in India. SEBI came up with this consultation paper after the International Organisation of Securities Commissions’ report on ‘ESG Ratings and Data Product Providers’. In the consultation paper, SEBI acknowledged the ambiguity and inconsistency in ESG products, such as ESG Impact Ratings, and ESG Corporate Risk Ratings. Furthermore, it noted that there is a potential risk of greenwashing since there is no uniformity in the rating methodologies. Greenwashing refers to deceptive practicesemployed by businesses to portray themselves as more environmentally sustainable.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"In the consultation paper, SEBI proposed with regards to the ESG rating process that the rating methodology for a specific product should be consistent across all assigned ratings. Further, the ESG rating agencies are required to exercise due diligence and independent professional judgment to maintain objectivity and independence. However, it would have been prudent to provide more explicit standards for such diligence and judgment to enhance the reliability of the rating process.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"SEBI also undertook an in-depth analysis of the business model of the ESG rating agencies and compared it with the business models of the credit rating agencies. It noted that credit rating agencies follow an ‘issuer-pay’ model primarily because a credit rating is a mandatory requirement for the issuance of securities or listing in the markets. On the other hand, globally, ESG rating agencies follow a ‘subscriber-pay’ model where investors can subscribe to the rating services as there is no requirement for an ESG rating before the issuance of securities or listing in the markets. SEBI noted that a ‘subscriber-pay’ model may give rise to potential conflict of interest concerns. For instance, an investor subscribing to a specific rating offered by an ESG rating agency could demand a customised analysis based on the company’s goals.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"SEBI also recommended the ESG rating agencies to form specialised committees to execute the rating process. However, it refrained from proposing any standard rating scale to be followed by all the registered ESG rating agencies in India. This cautious approach may be based on the understanding that with the ESG landscape in India still being at a nascent stage and the markets constantly evolving, a premature imposition of such standard may hinder the natural growth of the industry. Further, this business model puts smaller investors in terms of monetary capacity at a disadvantageous position.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Upon reviewing the proposed framework relating to ESG rating agencies, it is evident that SEBI has followed an approach similar to the consultation paper. In the subsequent section, we analyse and comment on the SEBI’s framework related to ESG rating agencies under the Regulation.\",\n",

      "        \"Analysing the Regulatory Framework for the ESG Rating Agencies\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The Regulation has laid down stringent eligibility criteria for ESG rating agencies seeking registration from SEBI. Regulation 28E, inter-alia, mandates that they are required to submit a detailed business plan regarding ESG rating activity in India. Further, the targets mentioned in the business plan must be strictly related to their proposed operation in the Indian securities market and must be reasonable.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"SEBI, while framing the Regulation, has placed enhanced emphasis on the transparency and governance aspects of ESG rating agencies. As per the Regulation, they are required to maintain a website and disclose material information related to the ESG rating process. They also need to disclose their rating methodologies keeping in mind the confidential aspects of such methodologies. If there are any changes in the rating methodology, the ESG rating agencies are also required to explain the consequential changes on their website. The Regulation has made it mandatory to frame policies related to conflicts of interest, which needs to be published on the website. There is a blanket restriction on rating entities connected with the promoter of the ESG rating agency. The ESG rating agencies are also required to appoint a compliance officer to ensure compliance with the applicable laws. In case of any non-compliance, the compliance officer must report independently to SEBI on an immediate basis. Such measures would ensure information symmetry among the various classes of investors related to the functioning of ESG rating agencies.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"To prevent shareholding interlocks in the ESG rating sector, SEBI has introduced shareholding restrictions in the Regulation. An ESG rating agency cannot hold more than 10% of shareholding either directly or indirectly in any other ESG rating agency. SEBI’s approval is required if any ESG rating agency intends to acquire shares or voting rights exceeding 10% in any other ESG rating agency. Further, to prevent director interlocks, an ESG rating agency cannot have a representation on the board of directors of any other ESG rating agency. The global market for ESG rating agencies is heavily dominated by a few entities–MSCI ESG, Sustainalytics, RepRisk, and ISS Environmental & Social QualityScore. The shareholding restrictions would prevent such consolidation in this nascent industry. Further, restrictions related to board interlocks would prevent collusion among the ESG rating agencies.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The Regulation has laid down broad guidelines pertaining to the ESG rating process and monitoring of the ratings. SEBI has mandated that the ESG rating agencies should have written policies, procedures, and internal controls to ensure consistency in the application of the rating methodologies. Notably, SEBI has mandated the ESG rating agencies to consider the unique features of the Indian securities market while assigning ESG ratings. Additionally, they are required to periodically update and review their rating methodologies. The ratings of their client need to be continuously monitored unless the rating is withdrawn by SEBI. The Regulation mandates the ESG rating agencies to review their published ESG ratings either annually or more frequently as needed. Further, the agencies should have advanced technological tools to track the material developments related to ESG to update the ratings in a timely manner.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Under the Regulation, SEBI has imposed specific disclosure obligations on the ESG rating agencies. The Regulation stipulates that such an agency is required to disclose the definitions and symbols of their ratings. Further, the agencies must explicitly mention that their ESG ratings should not be considered as recommendations to buy, hold, or sell any securities.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"In sum, SEBI has imposed stringent compliance requirements and introduced corporate governance norms in the regulatory framework governing ESG rating agencies in India. Transparency and accountability on the part of the ESG rating agencies are the key underlying principles contained in the Regulation. However, the Regulation is silent on the potential risk of greenwashing since ESG disclosures are unaudited. Further, with the mandatory filing of Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reports from the financial year 2022-2023 for the top 1000 listed entities, the lack of uniformity in the ESG rating methodologies may facilitate false reporting.\",\n",

      "        \"Conclusion\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The rise of ESG investing has significantly influenced the importance of ESG rating agencies within the capital markets ecosystem. These agencies play a pivotal role, since the investment community relies on ESG scores to identify sustainable investment portfolios. The purpose of ESG ratings is to provide stakeholders with information regarding the quality of a company’s ESG practice. SEBI’s efforts to regulate ESG rating agencies in India is a step in the right direction. Future research in this domain should focus on the concerns related to heterogeneity in the ESG rating methodologies. Additionally, empirical research may focus on the impact of ESG ratings on investor preferences in the Indian context.\",\n",

Ltd., reversing the penalty that was levied on it by the Competition Commission of India (“CCI”) for not notifying a combination under section 43A of the Competition Act, 2002 (“the Act”). This was pertaining to ITC’s acquisition of trademarks and related assets of Johnson and Johnson’s (“J&J Pvt.

      "        \"Contextualizing Trademark Assignments under Merger Control \",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"A Combination, for the purpose of section 5 of the Act, is limited to the acquisition of one or more enterprises by one or more persons. An ‘Enterprise’, in turn, is defined under section 2(h) as any person or governmental department engaged in the activity of storage, production, or distribution of articles, goods, or services.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The CCI order dated 11 December 2017 held that trademark assignments fall within the ambit of ‘transfer of assets’ under the Act.  This holding stems from the scope of acquisition, given under section 2(a)(i) of the Act, i.e., acquisitions include the acquisition of shares, voting rights, and assets of the enterprise. The characterization of ‘assets’ found under Explanation to section 5(c) includes registered trademarks, GIs, copyrights, patents, etc.  By reading section 2(a)(i) with the Explanation to section 5(c), the CCI concluded that the purchase of the trademarks resulted in the purchase of the assets of J&J Pvt. Ltd., thereby constituting an ‘Acquisition of Enterprise’. \",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Furthermore, a reading of section 2(a)(ii), which brings ‘Control over Assets’ also within the meaning of ‘Acquisition’ for the purposes of combinations, further solidifies the intent of bringing trademarks under the realm of combinations. Even the European Commission in Otto/Primondo Assets (2010), categorically held that contractual purchase of intangible assets like trademarks, copyrights, domain names, etc. constitutes ‘Assets’ for the purposes of Article 3(1)(b) of EU Merger Regulation, 2004. This flows from the logical deduction that the trademarks are economic value-carrying assets, which will generate revenue for the assignee company. Drawing this to the Indian regime, the CCI in United Spirits, as early as 2013, approved the combination involving a trademark assignment along with technical know-how, undertaking a subjective evaluation of the potential effects of competition.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Hence, this showcases the need for affording a purposive interpretation to section 5 of the Act. This is because any literal construction that excludes intangible assets could render the principle of merger control redundant, as rightly held by the CCI and upheld by the NCLAT order. \",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Validity of Exemption Claim under Combination Regulations  \",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Schedule I of the Combination Regulations enlists types of acquisitions that lack the ability to cause an Appreciable Adverse Effect on Competition (“AAEC”) in the relevant market, thereby being exempted from the notification requirement. ITC Ltd. made a claim under Item 3 Schedule I of the Combination Regulations, 2011, which was rejected by the CCI in its entirety.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"This must be analysed in seriatim to decipher the rationality of the CCI’s stance, given that the NCLAT has only addressed the question of penalty imposition. The validity of the said claim rests upon the satisfaction of the following criteria:\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"(i) Acquisition must not be directly related to the business of the acquiring party or\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"(ii) Acquisition in the ordinary course of business (“OCB”), not leading to control over the enterprise whose assets are acquired. \",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Firstly, it is important to ascertain what constitutes a ‘direct relation’ to the business of an enterprise. There are two ways to determine the same. One being the substitutability test, evaluated in accordance with the relevant product market of the goods or services in question. This creates a strict segmentation, granting blanket protection from the notification requirement since, strictly speaking, ITC is neither involved in the production of handwashes nor prickly heat powder that automatically allows it to avail the exemption. On the other hand, the second approach  (preferred approach) offers a liberal connotation to ‘direct relation’, which is based on the principle that an acquirer naturally acquires enterprises having ‘overlapping product lines.’ This line of reasoning was adopted by the CCI in Schneider Electric and Larsen Toubro (2019), wherein it held that even though some of the target entity’s products were not substitutable, they can still be grouped as “overlapping products under one or more clusters based on their choice as portfolio/cluster”. Thus, the decision of the CCI to conclude that the trademark assignments were ‘directly related’ to the business of the acquirer in terms of falling under ‘personal care products’ is justified, rendering it ineligible to claim this exemption.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Secondly, whether the acquisition of such a trademark qualifies as a transaction done in the OCB would require reference to the Telecom Spectrum Case, wherein the CCI delineated OCB as “frequent, routine, and usual revenue transactions”. The said Transactions I & II were short-term and did not affect the operating capacity of the enterprise as ITC was not in the business of purchase or sale of registered trademarks. Thus, this substantiates the reasoning followed by the CCI to disallow ITC from claiming this exemption as well.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Thirdly, the condition regarding ‘control’ over the enterprise creates a precarious situation while examining it from the perspective of trademark assignment. Explanation (a) to section 5 of the Act categorically defines ‘control’ as controlling the management or affairs of the company. The Competition (Amendment) Act, 2023 has amended the interpretation of ‘control’ to include the exercise of ‘material influence’ over the commercial and strategic decisions of the target company.  Therefore, the primary question is whether the trademark assignment catapults in the exercise of material influence by the acquirer over the target company. \",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \" \",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Surprisingly, neither the CCI nor the NCLAT addressed the implications of trademark assignment on the acquirer-target entity equation. But if we undertake a conjoint reading of Section 2(1)(b) and 37 of the Trademarks Act, 1999 it can be argued that trademark assignments solely transfer ownership rights and goodwill with respect to the mark.  The test of control, as per section 5 of the Act, requires the acquirer to be able to dictate commercial decisions of the target entity. Since trademark assignments do not affect the decision-making capacity of the target entity, the test of control enshrined in section 5 of the Act remains unsatisfied. Though if read separately, such a ‘control’ requirement would open a pandora’s box in terms of enabling all such trademark assignments from benefiting this exemption, the same cannot be exploited since the OCB requirement goes hand in hand with the ‘control requirement’, making it harder to claim such an exemption. Even in the present case, though purchasing the trademarks of Savlon and Shower does not lead to ‘control’, the OCB requirement is still not satisfied.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Hence, the failure to satisfy the statutory criteria renders ITC Ltd. unable to claim the exemption benefit under Item 3, Schedule I of the Combination Regulations, 2011.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Affording Retrospectivity to the De Minimis Threshold\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The De Minimis threshold set by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) Notification dated 4 March 2016 exempted combinations from notifying CCI if the assets and turnover with the transferor company fall below Rs. 350 crores and Rs. 1,000 crores, respectively. A clarificatory notification dated 27 March 2017 was issued to clarify that the assets and turnover of the portion of the target entity being acquired will only be relevant for the purpose of the exemption, as opposed to the previous regime that considered the entire assets and turnover the acquirer as well as acquired parties. Given the trademark assignments, in the present case, took place on 12 February 2015, the question of retrospectivity is significant to claim the exemption.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"NCLAT’s decision of choosing to afford the retrospective application of the MCA’s clarification is justified and attributable to the contemporary approach adopted by courts in interpreting such notifications, as opposed to the CCI, which blindly categorised it as a ‘substantive change’ and held the contrary. The NCLAT’s decisions can be rooted in the following trends in interpretation:\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Hence, the NCLAT rightly held the exemption to be retrospectively applicable, and CCI’s rigid stance with respect to disallowing retrospective application is outdated.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Conclusion and Suggestions\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Though it was right on the part of NCLAT to have reversed the penalty imposed by the CCI, there is still much ambiguity caused by NCLAT refraining from commenting upon certain crucial aspects regarding IPR assignments. For instance, it was important for it to have commented upon the method to deal with trademark assignments considering the exemptions under Item 1 Schedule 3, specifically the ‘lack of control over enterprise’ requirement. Even though this provision specifies that the acquisition of assets that represent “substantial business operations” (irrespective of whether such assets are organised as a separate legal entity or not) are disallowed from availing the exemption, there is still a lot of ambiguity in this regard since even the Competition Amendment Act, 2023 introduces this term, it does not define the same. This must be done as soon as possible since trademark assignments such as the present case require such contextualization.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Furthermore, with regards to affording retrospective applicability, one cannot deny the floodgates argument, which will be inevitable for cases in which CCI had imposed a penalty for notification based on entire assets and turnover. An evident example would be the SRF-DuPont deal, wherein the CCI levied a penalty of Rs. 10 lakhs without considering the portion of the business of Du Pont (only pharmaceutical propellants) being acquired and considered the entire asset/turnover. Even if companies decide to approach the NCLAT to reverse the order of penalty, it must be noted that the Competition (Amendment) Act, 2023, requires the Appellant to deposit 25% of the penalty amount to file an appeal. This creates a financial impediment that inhibits companies from approaching the NCLAT.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Thus, even though the reversal of penalty is warranted in the present case, this landmark judgment has conclusively ruled regarding the classification of IPRs as assets. However, it falls short of addressing the substantive questions concerning the intersection of IPR assignments and combination with respect to availment of the notification exemption.\",\n",

This legal dispute revolved around the rights of the highest bidder and the liquidator’s discretion to reject the highest bid once the bidding process had concluded. A conflict arose between the provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC) and the E-Auction Process Information Document (hereinafter “Document”) regarding the liquidator’s authority.\",\n",

The liquidator duly issued notices for the sale of the property, and the appellant emerged as the sole bidder in the e-auction process, which was conducted in accordance with the terms outlined in the Document. The Court, in its deliberation, referred to this Document and identified several key clauses that needed consideration.\",\n",

It referred to para 1(11A) of schedule I of the Insolvency Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) Regulation, 2016 (hereinafter “Regulation”), which mandated that the liquidator provide a justifiable reason for rejecting the highest bidder. However, the respondent’s counsel argued that this provision had only come into effect on 30 September 2021 and that it applied prospectively. Also, he argued that Schedule I clause 1(11) allows the liquidator to conduct multiple rounds of auction to maximise the realisation from the sale. Consequently, in the present case, there was no requirement for the liquidator to furnish a reason for cancelling the highest bid.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The Court concurred with the argument concerning the prospective application of para 1(11A), but asserted that even then the arbitrary exercise of the liquidator’s discretion must be curtailed. It invoked the principle of natural justice to affirm that the act of “giving reasons” was an integral aspect of this principle, a point repeatedly upheld in various cases. The requirement to provide reasons implies the application of a reasoned judgment, which serves as a safeguard against arbitrary power. Furthermore, it argued that the “right to reason” was an inherent natural justice principle within the IBC, and para 1(11A) had merely conferred statutory recognition upon this well-established principle. Hence, the liquidator could not cancel the highest bid at their unfettered discretion and without offering any justification.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Regarding the absolute and unfettered discretion granted to the liquidator under clause 3(k) of the Document, the Court construed it in conjunction with clause 2(m), which requires the information provided in the Document to be read in conjunction with sections 35 and 36 of the IBC on the power and duties of the liquidator in the legislation. Consequently, through a combined reading of the relevant clauses of the document and the provisions of the IBC, the Court determined that the highest bidder did not possess an absolute entitlement to demand acceptance of their bid. Nonetheless, the liquidator was obliged to exercise their judgment before rejecting the highest bidder’s offer, and this exercise of judgment must be evident in the rejection order itself. The Court harmoniously reconciled the Document’s provisions with the liquidator’s responsibilities under the IBC.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Furthermore, the Court emphasized that the mere anticipation by the liquidator of obtaining a higher price was an insufficient basis for cancelling a legally valid auction. The logical outcome of this interpretation was that within an administrative framework like the IBC, the liquidator could not wield unrestricted or arbitrary discretionary authority. The IBC delineates clear duties and obligations for the liquidator, which must be executed objectively. The liquidator lacks the authority to arbitrarily nullify a legally valid auction.\",\n",

      "\n",
      "        \"To bolster its argument regarding the implicit nature of the “right to reason” in the liquidation process, the Court relied upon several precedents. In SN Mukherjee v Union of India, the Supreme Court established that the requirement to record reasons can be equated with the broader principle of natural justice. The overarching objective behind the principles of natural justice is to prevent miscarriages of justice and ensure the fair application of procedures.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"In State of Orissa v Dhaniram Luhar, the Court reiterated the paramount importance of providing reasons in decision-making, whether it is in the realm of administrative, quasi-judicial, or judicial actions. This underscores the critical role that reasons play in fostering transparency and accountability in the decision-making process. A similar ruling was delivered in East Coast Railway v Mahadev Appa Rao, where the Court recognized that arbitrariness in the issuance of orders by an authority can manifest itself through various means. The most effective way to demonstrate the application of due consideration and thoughtful judgment is by formally recording the reasons that led the authority to issue the specific order in question.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"In Kranti Association (P) Ltd v Masood Ahmed Khan, the Court emphasized that any order passed by a quasi-judicial or even an administrative authority must be articulate and well-reasoned. This requirement underscores the necessity for orders to be “speaking orders”, meaning they must convey the rationale and thought process behind the decision. Furthermore, the Court also contextualized the “right to hearing” within an administrative framework by referencing the AK Kraipak and Keshav Mills cases, where the distinction between quasi-judicial and administrative authorities became less distinct. These cases illuminate the evolving nature of administrative processes and the increasing importance of procedural fairness, including the right to be heard, in administrative decision-making.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Furthermore, in the past, appellate courts have consistently affirmed the implicit presence of the principle of natural justice in the adjudication of disputes under the IBC. An illustrative case in this regard is Sree Metaliks Ltd v The Union of India, where a challenge was raised concerning the absence of the principle of natural justice under section 7 of the IBC. In its ruling, the Court firmly established that the adjudicating authority is duty-bound to afford a “reasonable opportunity of hearing” to the corporate debtor. This ruling effectively construed the “right to a fair hearing” as an inherent administrative rule within the framework of the IBC.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Subsequently, in Starlog Enterprises Ltd. v. ICICI Bank Ltd., the Court further clarified that the “right to give notice” to the corporate debtor is a mandatory duty of the adjudicating authority to ensure a fair hearing. This interpretation solidified the importance of providing adequate notice in maintaining procedural fairness. In Era Infra Engineering Ltd. v. Prideco Commercial Pvt. Ltd., the Court once again emphasized the significance of the “right to notice”. This was particularly evident as the operational creditor failed to serve proper notice, thereby reaffirming the principle that notice is an integral component of due process. Likewise, in HS Oberoi Pvt Ltd v Inderjit Singh, the NCLAT upheld the principle of natural justice due to the adjudicating authority’s failure to offer an opportunity for a hearing, which constituted a violation of the fundamental principle of audi alterum partem. Therefore, these cases collectively underscore the consistent judicial recognition of the principle of natural justice in IBC disputes and highlight the critical importance of providing corporate debtors with a reasonable opportunity to be heard and duly informed.\",\n",

      "        \"The imposition of tax in the gaming industry is an issue that has long plagued both stakeholders and academics alike. With the Parliament tabling an amendment to the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (the ‘CGST Act’) to precipitate the levy of 28% goods and services tax (GST) on online real money games, concerns regarding its incidence have only been aggravated. Of particular importance is the decision to tax the “face values” of the amounts paid by users, as against solely the platform fees or the gross gaming revenue. Such “face value” has two primary components – a fee collected for platform use, that is, the platform fee, and an amount pooled into an escrow amount, which forms part of the prize money in the case of real money games. The prize money is transferred to the winner of the real money game. Consequently, the latter has been deemed an “actionable claim” by the Bombay High Court in Gurdeep Singh Sachar and by the Karnataka High Court in Gameskraft Technologies owing to it conferring a right upon players to claim prize money upon winning.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The Problem\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Such characterization of prize money as an actionable claim raises a pertinent issue. The judiciary has repeatedlydistinguished “actionable claims” from “goods” in cases involving the applicability of goods tax statutes. Article 336(12) of the Constitution of India circumscribes the definition of “goods” to “materials, commodities and articles” and any tax statute positing a definition foraying beyond this is immediately arraigned as being unconstitutional (see H Anraj, Sunrise Associates or Skill Lotto). Even the CGST Act adhered to this scheme until recently. Schedule III of the CGST Act specifically excluded actionable claims from the purview of supply and, consequently, of taxation. Yet, the forthcoming amendment seeks to conflate actionable claims with goods by introducing “specific actionable claims” within the scope of supply. Further, such claims have been purported to include online money gaming vide the newly introduced clause 102A.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"In this post, I argue that the Indian judiciary has consistently excluded actionable claims from the constitutional definition of goods. I further argue that even if prize money as an actionable claim could potentially be included within the definition of goods, the imposition of GST solely on the prize money in online gaming as against all actionable claims generally, is susceptible to constitutional claims on account of hostile discrimination and violation of Article 14.\",\n",

      "        \"Actionable Claims are Rights, Not Concrete Goods\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Section 2(1) of the CGST Act confers upon actionable claims the same definition assigned to it by section 3 of the Transfer of Property Act. According to section 3, an actionable claim essentially means a claim to an unsecured debt or a beneficial interest in movable property not in the claimant’s possession which civil courts utilized as affording grounds for relief to the claimant. In H Anraj, the Supreme Court held that a lottery ticket was an actionable claim on account of it being “a right to a prize upon the payment of a price.”\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The issue in this case was whether Article 246(3), which conferred upon states the power to tax the sale of goods, could be applied to the sale of lottery tickets. While the Court ultimately decided in the affirmative, it did so by adopting a convoluted strategy of splitting the lottery ticket into two components – a saleable element and an actionable claim. While the former was liable to taxation, the latter was conclusively declared exempt from it. This was because the definition of goods in Article 366(12) did not comprehend inchoate claims to property.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"A five-judge bench of the Supreme Court in Sunrise Associates reaffirmed this finding. However, it found that the sale of lottery tickets would be susceptible to taxation. This was because an actionable claim when sold and purchased “like a good” attained a different quality, so as to fall under Article 366(12)’s inclusive definition of a good. Here, it is pertinent to note that the Court did not undermine its interpretation of an actionable claim as referring to a “right.” It merely utilized a functional definition of a good – that which was treated like a good would be taxed as one. This judgement’s inclusion of actionable claims within Article 366(12) is therefore restricted to instances where actionable claims are themselves being sold and purchased like goods with intrinsic value.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Similarly, courts have held various other rights in movable property to be actionable claims. In Bharti Airtel, recharge vouchers were declared actionable claims since they created a “right to receive telephone services.” Courts have also termed actionable claims rights to arrears of rent, to provident funds, to reward points earned by customers under loyalty programmes, to profits from profit-sharing agreements and so on.\",\n",

In Teesta Distributors, the Calcutta High Court allowed the imposition of GST on the prize money collected by a lottery gaming platform. The Court sanguinely relied upon the legal framework outlined above to arrive at its conclusion without much reference to the constitutionality of such taxation.\",\n",

Predictably, the petitioners’ arguments were three-fold: first, they contended based on established precedent that actionable claims were exempt from the constitutional definition of goods; second, they argued that the prize monies collected via lotteries, betting or gambling, being actionable claims were consequently exempt from GST; and third, they argued that the selective imposition of GST on prize money collected from these three activities to the exclusion of others was an exercise in hostile discrimination and violative of Article 14. In response to these contentions, the three-judge bench interpreted Sunrise Associates in an overly-broad manner to hold that all actionable claims were included within Article 366(12)’s “goods”. Simply put, the bench ignored the limited functional test applied in Sunrise Associates. Thereby, it concluded that section 2(52) and Entry 6 of Schedule III were not unconstitutional.  With regards to the Article 14 contention, the Court observed that the Government could make reasonable classifications in furtherance of a legitimate aim – the legitimate aim here being the need to combat gaming addiction and interest in curbing acts that undermined public policy.  The existence and judicial affirmative of various gambling legislation indicate the legitimacy of such objectives. The decision in Skill Lotto has also served to justify the continued imposition of a 28% GST on gambling activities.\",\n",

Further, in recent cases like Gameskraft, Gurdeep Singh Sachar, Varun Gumbar and Ravindra Singh Chaudhary, the High Courts have categorically stated that actionable claims in games of skill are still excluded from the scope of GST.  Nevertheless, the GST Council has still relied upon Skill Lotto to propose taxation on actionable claims in all online games involving prize money. The proposed amendment sought to be made to the CGST Act is further predicated upon these recommendations. This highlights the sharp inconsistency and confusion pervading the field.

There seems to be no stated legitimate objective to this classification. Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has observed that a uniform tax on all components of the amounts paid by players would “increase transparency” in an opaque field. Yet others speculate that the tax is intended at taxing international players who play from outside India and players who use digital forms of consideration like cryptocurrency and so on. However, justifications have not been provided for these reasons and there seems to be no cogent reason to treat online gaming on par with its gambling counterparts.\",\n",

Second, it has shown that lotteries and other gambling activities, despite being actionable claims, have been taxed under the GST due to the presence of a legitimate state objective justifying such taxation. Third, it has argued that the proposed amendment to the CGST Act intending to extend the application of CGST to actionable claims collected by all online gaming services, is susceptible to claims of Article 14 violations, given the lack of a legitimate objective buttressing it.

This post aims to comprehensively critique SEBI’s narrow interpretation of this exemption in a specific case. The author will begin by outlining the facts and the guidance sought from SEBI. Subsequently, it will analyse the inter-se transfer exemption and its operational framework under the Takeover Code. Finally, it will discuss the potential implications of SEBI’s narrow construction of the exemption.\",\n",

      "        \"The case revolves around Vidli Restaurants Limited (“Target Company”) and its three promoters: Dr. Vidhi V. Kamat, Kamats Worldwide Food Services Private Limited (“KWFSPL”), and Vits Hotels Worldwide Private Limited (“VHWPL”). VHWPL held a majority shareholding in the Target Company. Dr. Vidhi Kamat intended to gift 9998 equity shares held by herself in Vits Hotels Worldwide Pvt. Ltd. to Dr. Vikram V. Kamat, her husband, i.e., to her “immediate relative”.\",\n",

According to the facts provided, Dr. Vikram V. Kamat currently does not hold any equity shares or voting rights (VRs) in the Target Company. As a result of this proposed transaction, Dr. Vikram Kamat’s shareholding in VITS Hotels Worldwide Pvt. Ltd. would increase to 99.99% of the equity shareholding. Consequently, he would indirectly acquire control over the Target Company, along with his wife, who already holds a 13.30% shareholding in the Target Company. This cumulative shareholding triggers a mandatory offer requirement.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The key question for SEBI’s analysis is whether the proposed transaction is eligible for exemption under regulation 10(1)(a)(i) of the Takeover Code.

Rather, it involves the transfer of shares of the holding company, VHWPL. The guidance stated that inter-se transfer exemption provided under the Takeover Code does not apply to transfers of shares in the holding company. Therefore, the transaction is not eligible for the inter-se transfer exemption, and the parties involved are not exempt from the open offer obligations under the Takeover Code.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"SEBI has, however, indicated that the parties involved can submit an exemption application under regulation 11(1) of the Takeover Code to seek relief from the open offer requirements. Even while noting that Dr. Vikram is a member of the promoter group in the case at hand, a condition that itself operates as an “automatic exemption” as it is counted as an inter-se transfer,  the informal guidance clarified that the inter-se transfer exemption applies specifically to transfers of shares among “immediate relatives” of promoters within the target company. The implication is that in cases where control of the target company is indirectly acquired through the transfer of shares of the promoter entity in the holding company instead of the takeover company, the automatic exemption from making an open offer does not apply.\",\n",

Regulation 3, read with regulation 5, specifies that even in cases of indirect acquisitions where the cumulative shareholding or voting rights exceed 25%, a public announcement of an open offer is required. However, regulation 10 provides automatic exemptions, including inter-se transfers, where an open offer is not mandatory. The author proposes that if direct and indirect acquisitions are treated at par with each other for the purposes of triggering an open offer, it should be treated no differently when it comes to assessing their eligibility for exemptions to this requirement under regulation 10.\",\n",

      "        \"An inter-se transfer involves qualified parties such as immediate relatives, identified promoters, companies and their subsidiaries, persons acting in concert, and shareholders who have been persons acting in concert.

This concept ought to be examined in the context of the regulatory framework for exemptions to the open offer requirement. Parties pursuing a common objective or purpose to acquire shares, voting rights, or control over the target company are considered persons acting in concert. This includes companies under the same management or control as the acquiring entity. The author contends that acquisitions of shares or voting rights within the same group, where control of the target company remains unchanged, may not necessitate a mandatory open offer.\",\n",

The purpose behind the consultation paper is to solicit public comments on various measures intended to clamp down on the association of SEBI-registered entities and intermediaries with unregistered ‘finfluencers’. While the proposed regulation purports to protect the interests of the average retail investor who may unseeingly heed to the guidance of unregistered finfluencers, certain vital questions remain unaddressed.\",\n",

      "        \"Currently, finfluencers belong to a regulatory ‘grey area’. The SEBI (Investment Advisors) Regulations, 2013 (‘IA Regulations’) and the SEBI (Research Analysts) Regulations, 2014 (‘RA Regulations’) prohibit any person from acting as an IA or RA, respectively, without having obtained a certificate of registration from SEBI. Regulation 7 of the IA Regulations stipulate specific academic qualifications (and further certifications), and “at least five years of experience in “activities relating to advice in financial products or securities or fund or asset or portfolio management” to qualify for IA certification. The RA Regulations specify similar educational and professional qualifications required to be registered as a research analyst.\",\n",

      "        \"Regulatory requirements on possessing appropriate qualifications, scrutiny of trades and non-gratuitous contact with anyone other than those being advised are arguably the primary reasons finfluencers are hesitant to obtain requisite registrations as IAs and RAs. Frequently, finfluencers receive what the consultation paper notes as undisclosed financial compensation from SEBI-registered entities and intermediaries. In return for such compensation, they influence their followers by providing investment advice despite often lacking qualifications mandated by the law to be an IA. Not only will a considerable number of finfluencers not qualify to be registered as an IA or RA, even if they do have the necessary qualifications, there will be a regulatory bar from obtaining any compensation from the registered entities or intermediaries, as the finfluencers are not providing any investment advice to these entities.\",\n",

Therefore, it recognised a need to curb the flow of such compensation from registered intermediaries or regulated entities with such unregistered entities. Furthermore, being unregistered, such finfluencers may not have the requisite qualifications or expertise on the subject, nor are they subject to a code of conduct requiring disclosures of conflicts of interests, etc.\",\n",

They would also be prohibited from sharing confidential information of their clients with such unregistered entities. It has also proposed prohibiting registered intermediaries or regulated entities from paying any trailing commission based on the number of referrals as a referral fee. However, it has proposed a carve-out for limited referrals from retail clients and payment of fees for such limited referrals by stockbrokers. Furthermore, SEBI registered intermediaries/registered entities may be required to take active measures to dissociate themselves from any unregistered entity using their name, product or service, and take necessary action through enforcement agencies, including by registering cases under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code.\",\n",

      "        \"Critical Analysis of the Proposed Regulations\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The proposed regulations outlined in the consultation paper appear to be a positive step in addressing the negative impacts that may arise from biased and potentially financially motivated advice provided by unregistered finfluencers to their followers. However, some critical questions regarding the practical implementation of these regulations have not been addressed.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The first important question vis-à-vis the implementation of the proposed regulations pertains to the lack of clarity regarding how content published by unregistered finfluencers, in violation of any existing or proposed regulations on this matter, will be dealt with. Today’s finfluencers give investment advice through various social media and content-hosting platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube. Currently, matters pertaining to taking down content on the internet are governed by the Information Technology Act, 2000, read with the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 and the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking of Access of Information by the Public) Rules, 2009. The procedures for the same are arduous and lengthy – blocking content in breach of the statutory framework through this route would be impractical and could hinder the effective implementation of the proposed regulations. By the time necessary procedures and formalities are completed, irreversible damage, vis-à-vis influencing retail investors, will have likely occurred.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"A second important question that could be worthwhile for the securities watchdog to consider would be the applicability of the proposed regulations on non-resident unregistered finfluencers dispensing advice to Indian residents. The Supreme Court in Securities and Exchange Board of India v. Pan Asia Advisors Ltd. held that SEBI’s jurisdiction extends to any person, including “citizens abroad” and those not “corporally present” in India committing an act which “affects the legitimate interest of this country”. Therefore, clarity on enforcement of the proposed regulations to such influencers may be beneficial. Further, jurisdictions like the United States and Hong Kong require investment advisors (or their domestic equivalents) to be registered with, or obtain requisite licenses from regulatory authorities to provide investment advice. Thus, recognition of finfluencers registered in their respective jurisdictions may also be looked into.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Finally, while the proposed regulations seek to address the threat posed by finfluencers through the regulation of registered intermediaries, SEBI has also expressed an intention to take enforcement action against all finfluencers in breach of existing SEBI Regulations. Therefore, a critical question left unanswered is the very applicability of the IA and RA Regulations to finfluencers. SEBI, in the consultation paper, refers to finfluencers as “effectively unregistered and unauthorized Investment  Advisers (IAs) or Research  Analysts (RAs)”. However, the proviso to Regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations, defining ‘investment advice’, explicitly excludes “advice given through newspaper, magazines, any electronic or broadcasting or telecommunications medium, which is widely available to the public” from the ambit of investment advice. This seemingly results in a conundrum concerning the applicability of the regulations on finfluencers. This question has become relevant in light of SEBI’s recent Settlement Order in respect of Mansun Consultancy Private Limited, Mr. P.R. Sundar and Ms. Mangayarkarsi Sundar. Mr. P.R. Sundar, who provided investment advice through his website and telegram channels, was said to have provided said investment advice without obtaining the requisite registration under the IA regulations. The Settlement Order was issued without considering the proviso to the definition, by which arguably Mr. P.R. Sundar was not providing any investment advice to his followers. A modification to this definition to the necessary extent of including the advice usually dispensed by finfluencers would resolve this theoretical regulatory roadblock.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"ConclusionThe widespread dissemination of unchecked investment advice by unregulated finfluencers poses a significant threat to the public. This threat is magnified by the potentially financially incentivized nature of investment advice given by such influencers, which is not disclosed to the unassuming retail investor. The consultation paper represents a commendable stride toward essential regulatory measures to mitigate these potential harms, safeguarding the financial interests of investors and promoting responsible financial content. Resolving the questions raised in this post would aid in establishing a robust mechanism for mitigating the potential risks associated with such advice.\",\n",

      "        \"Section 12(2)(a) says that a woman will be entitled to maternity benefits if she is discharged or dismissed “at any time during her pregnancy”. If the line followed by Supreme Court is adopted, a woman employee would be entitled to avail maternity benefits even in cases where her term of employment has ended much before commencement of maternity benefits. This ambiguity is further compounded by the Court’s observation that a woman will be entitled to full maternity benefits once she has fulfilled the entitlement criteria specified in section 5(2) (i.e., 80 day employment).\",\n",

Prior to this change, a director’s fiduciary duty was limited to protecting and acting in the company’s best interests. The Indian Companies Act, while continuing to impose this directorial obligation to act in the best interests of the company, its employees and the shareholders, now also requires director to act “for the protection of environment” [section 166(2)].\",\n",

The Court observed that “the history of evolution of the corporate world shows that it has moved from the: (i) familial to (ii) contractual and managerial to (iii) a regime of social accountability and responsibility. This is why Section 166(2) also talks about the duty of a Director to protect environment, in addition to his duties to: (i) promote the objects of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole; and (ii) act in the best interests of the company, its employees, the shareholders and the community”.

More importantly, and in addition to a monetary penalty, if a company’s shareholders believe that the directors’ decision(s) appears to tip towards promoting profits at the cost of environmental conservation, such shareholders would arguably have the right under section 241 of the Indian Companies Act to approach the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) and contend that the company’s affairs are being conducted in a manner prejudicial to public interest.

In the absence of any evidence of abuse of discretion, courts would typically refrain from second-guessing the decision of a properly functioning board of directors, even if it may not have been the best decision in the company’s interests [Fisher vs. Cadman [2005] EWHC 377 (Ch)].\",\n",

Naturally, factors such as the diligence exercised by the board, vested interests, if any, of the directors, material considered by the board, the director’s independence, etc. would play a crucial role in determining the outcome of any such challenge. However, given the manner in which courts in the United Kingdom and the United States of America have dealt with such claims, particularly ClientEarth’s action, one can assume that the business judgment rule would be an important shield for directors facing prosecution.\",\n",

Therefore, it granted exclusive jurisdiction to the Controller General of Patents over the Competition Commission of India (“CCI”). Reversing its single-judge decision in 2016 (“Ericsson I”), the High Court held that it would be contrary to legislative intent to permit CCI to conduct inquiries in allegations of anti-competitive agreements concerning patents.

Section 84 of the Patents Act stipulates conditions for an application for granting compulsory licence on a patent. Section 84(6)(iv) requires the applicant to make efforts to procure the licence on reasonable terms. However, the proviso to this clause carves an exception to the above requirement, when the patentee adopts anti-competitive practices.\",\n",

Therefore, even in anti-competitive issues related to patents, the Controller will have exclusive jurisdiction. Moreover, compulsory licenses under Chapter XVI were introduced by the 2003 amendment, after the enactment of the Competition Act. This was interpreted by the Court as conclusive legislative intent granting exclusivity of jurisdiction to the Controller.

The Court’s reasoning was two-fold: first, the inclusion of section 84(6)(iv) in the Patents Act after the enactment of the Competition Act shows legislative intention in favour of the former. Second, since the powers of both the CCI and the Controller are similar, the latter shall have exclusive jurisdiction.

The proviso carves out an exception when the patentee indulges in anti-competitive practices. On the other hand, section 3(5)(i)(b) of the Competition Act allows the imposition of ‘reasonable conditions’ restraining competition, to protect the rights granted under the Patents Act. Ericsson II posits that since CCI is barred from examining ‘reasonable conditions’ and the Controller can take into account anti-competitive practices, exclusive jurisdiction lies with the latter. Such a position is, with respect, flawed.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The object of the proviso to section 84(6)(iv) is altogether different. While the provision requires a licensee to make efforts to obtain a license on valid terms, the proviso simply exempts such a requirement in case the patentee adopts anti-competitive practices. The same is not a substantive provision on preventing anti-competitive practices. On the other hand, section 3(5)(i)(b) of the Competition Act allows ‘reasonable conditions’ in agreements restraining Competition if such a condition is under a statutory right. Therefore, such clauses will not be regarded as anti-competitive. It is submitted that section 3(5)(i)(b) does not exclude the examination of such clauses by the CCI completely. The term ‘reasonable’ implies that the CCI will have to check for such reasonability. If it finds the term not to be reasonable, there is nothing to stop it from declaring it void under section 27 of the Act.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Further, the object of introducing section 84 under Chapter XVI of the Patents Act was not to ensure fair competition as a comprehensive measure. The Joint Parliamentary Committee Report specifically stated that the primary object of the amendment to the said Chapter is to make patents relating to the health sector more conducive and affordable. The speech of the Commerce Minister, introducing the bill, also clarifies the same. Section 84 simply allows the Controller to grant compulsory licenses to prevent the abuse of patents that are in the public interest. Moreover, section 89 clarifies that the general purpose of compulsory licensing is to attain proper utilisation of patent rights.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"In this regard, section 83(b) of the Patents Act may also be considered. It states that patents are not merely to allow a monopoly to patentees. It can be argued that section 83(b) read with section 84 has been enacted to prevent anti-competitive practices. However, a few provisions targeting anti-competitive practices should not be equated to a comprehensive regime for guaranteeing fair competition. Furthermore, section 90(1)(ix) of the Patents Act uses the phrase “determined after judicial or administrative process to be anti-competitive”. This has been correctly interpreted by Ericsson I as the legislative intention of harmonising the Competition Act with Patent law. Ericsson II has not even considered the import of this section which directly goes against the exclusivity of the Patents Act. Therefore, the legislative intention is strictly not in favour of the Patent Act’s exclusivity.\",\n",

      "\n",
      "        \"The preceding section has shown that the legislative intention was never to exclude the jurisdiction of CCI. This section will show how Ericsson II failed to appreciate the expansive powers of the CCI over the Controller in ensuring effective competition.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Certain provisions of the Patents Act do deal with the anti-competitiveness of Patents. Section 84, as discussed above, is one of them. Section 90(1)(ix) allows that licensee to export the product if such a license is granted to remedy a practice determined to be anti-competitive. Further, section 140 prohibits any license agreement from having anti-competitive terms. On a prima facie basis, it may seem that the Act does give the Controller wide powers to deal with anti-competitive practices concerning patents. However, such powers are limited. First, the powers of the Controller are in personem and not in rem unlike that of the CCI. Therefore, they are related to the specific patent or license. Second,checking for anti-competitive clauses in particular patents or licenses cannot be equated with prohibiting adverse effects on competition as a whole. While the Controller’s authority is limited to the former, the CCI’s role covers the latter. For example, CCI might be better equipped to keep a check on patent cartels and monopolistic combinations than the Controller. Sections 3 and 4 of the Competition Act not only deal with simple anti-competitive agreements but also with cartels, combinations and other kinds of restrictive practices. Further, section 19(3)(f) of the Competition Act requires the CCI to consider the promotion of market innovative practices in determining the anti-competitive effects of an agreement. Consequently, CCI’s regulation of anti-competitive practices promotes market innovation in the long run. Therefore, the CCI has wider powers and can better check such practices even in the field of patents.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The above contention finds support in the Ayyangar Committee Report as well. The committee suggested that restrictive practices in patents cannot be dealt with by simply amending the Patent Act, but requires more comprehensive tools to deal with the various types of restrictive combinations. Similar is the view taken by the Raghavan Committee. It has emphasised the distinction between the “existence of a right and its exercise”. It recommended that anti-competitive practices in the exercise of such a right “ought to be” checked under the Competition regime. Further, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) Report on ‘Competition Policy and Intellectual Property Rights’ also highlights the benefits of applying competition policy on licensing of intellectual property.\",\n",

      "        \"In CCI v Bharti Airtel (“Airtel”), the Supreme Court had to deal with a similar tussle of jurisdiction between Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (“TRAI”) and the CCI. It mentioned that the CCI has a distinct object to ensure fair competition. It went on to posit that CCI is better equipped to find whether an agreement can have adverse effects on competition. It held that TRAI cannot have exclusive jurisdiction, because even if TRAI finds the agreement anti-competitive, it cannot transcend the TRAI Act. On the other hand, CCI exclusively deals with these agreements, therefore a better choice. Ironically, this case was heavily relied upon by the Court in Ericsson II. Here, the court has clearly failed to recognise distinct mandates of the statutory bodies. Moreover, in Airtel, the Court had granted CCI a follow-on jurisdiction. It granted TRAI the original jurisdiction and CCI could investigate only after TRAI had concluded its inquiry. Interestingly, no such possibility was even considered by the Court in Ericsson II.\",\n",

      "        \"In Ashoka Marketing v. Punjab National Bank, the Supreme Court held the policy and schemes of the acts as a factor in determining if there exists a ‘conflict’ between two statutes. At the outset, the larger objectives of the two statutes may seem to be in opposition to each other. However, substantive scrutiny of the provisions, as conducted above points to the contrary. This shows that the scheme of the Competition Act is not in ‘conflict’ with the wider aim of the Patents Act. Therefore, the Court’s reasoning in Ericsson II is based on an erroneous presumption of “conflict” between the two statutes. An approach akin to this, by creating a hierarchy between the statutes, ignores the material distinctions between their substantive provisions. If the reasoning in Ericsson II is accepted, then combination anti-competitive arrangements in patents may remain unchecked.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Therefore, this post has shown that granting exclusive jurisdiction to the Controller was first, not the correct interpretation of legislative intent; and second, ignores the wide-ranging power vested with the CCI. The decision in Ericsson II calls for definite principles to demarcate the contours of the two regimes. Harmonising the two is not unheard of. Section 21 of the Competition Act allows other statutory authorities to refer a matter to the CCI. It has been argued that such a provision shows the intent to harmonise the Patents Act and the Competition regime.  It remains to be seen how long the Ericsson II continues to hold ground. It would do well for trade if the Supreme Court settles this contentious issue through a well-reasoned judgment.\",\n",

Weeks after releasing a consultation paper to control unregistered finfluencers, SEBI on 31 August 2023 released a consultation paper to establish a Performance Validation Agency (PVA). The primary objectives of the PVA are to facilitate SEBI-registered intermediaries in disclosing their performance to investors for credibility enhancement and growth, while safeguarding investors’ interests against unverified claims. This post assesses SEBI’s proposal to establish a PVA, and its possible impact on the Indian financial market.\",\n",

While SEBI is yet to provide the complete eligibility criteria for PVA, it is proposed to operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of market infrastructure institutions (MII) or multiple MIIs. This choice is motivated by the expected need for PVA to handle vast amounts of data, for which MIIs possess the requisite expertise.\",\n",

To determine this criterion, the PVA will be free to collaborate with other knowledge partners, such as credit rating agencies. However, the paper makes it a mandate for the PVA to maintain confidentiality throughout the process. Notably, the PVA can charge a reasonable fee for its validation services.\",\n",

For instance, the entity should display performance validation for client-specific recommendations on its website, with restricted access only to the client to which that information pertains. In contrast, validations for publicly made recommendations must be displayed on the same day on both PVA’s and the intermediary’s websites. This display should be in a format as may be prescribed by the industry forum in consultation with the PVA and SEBI. Similarly, the performance of all the algorithms shared with the PVA for validation shall be disclosed and displayed on the website of the PVA.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The Rationale Behind PVA\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"SEBI’s proposal to establish the PVA stems from a twofold need. First, there exists a lacuna for verifying the investment-related claims made by entities, as there is no standardised mechanism. For instance, although the SEBI circular already requires that IA/RA refrain from making false or exaggerated claims, investors lack the means to verify the accuracy of these claims independently. This led to an increased number of entities making exaggerated claims regarding their recommendations to attract investors. It is pertinent to note that verification from a single brokerage firm can mislead investors since they do not provide a complete picture of a person’s trading performance across all accounts.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Second, there has been consistent demand from some entities like IAs and RAs, who are not permitted to make reference to their past performances while giving advice. Similarly, stock brokers, too, cannot refer to past performance or expected future performance of the algorithm. There has been consistent demand to allow them to showcase their performance to increase their business. To address these challenges, there is a need for an independent and impartial body like the PVA to undertake impartial verification of investment-related claims made by entities.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"PVA’s Role in Transforming Investment Culture: Prospects and Concerns\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The proposal to establish the PVA is a commendable initiative. Past performance is a crucial factor for investors when making investment decisions, and there is substantial reliance on historical data when selecting investment avenues. The establishment of the PVA will introduce uniform criteria for claim verification, potentially shifting the paradigm from self-declaratory practices (which can be misleading) to a more rigorous validation approach. This initiative benefits both investors and intermediaries. Intermediaries with truthful and accurate claims will receive validation from the PVA, enhancing their credibility. Simultaneously, investors will be protected from unverified and potentially misleading claims from other intermediaries and entities.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"One noteworthy aspect of the proposal is that though the PVA possess the power to validate the claims, it does not have the discretion to select the claims or performances to be verified to benefit a particular stock or person. For instance, validation of actual profits is to be made for all the investors of a specific intermediary or entity, and no cherry-picking is permitted. If only the gain of a particular investor is verified, then such a report will be accessible only to that investor.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"The PVA’s validation standards may be more challenging to meet for smaller intermediaries and companies as the majority of them have limited financial resources and operational capacity compared to larger counterparts. Compliance with the validation standards would not only be limited to the payment of fee but would also require data gathering and reporting, which could lead to an unequal playing field. Furthermore, smaller participants might face trouble raising the necessary funds to comply with the PVA’s rules. Investors and lenders can be reluctant to fund or make investments in companies under more stringent regulatory scrutiny.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"According to the proposal, the PVA should verify claims using criteria including returns, risk, volatility, and other appropriate measures. However, the validation process may result in delays in reporting and informing investors. Investors could not have access to the most recent information while making investment decisions if the PVA takes an extended period to evaluate allegations. The proposal suggests that the PVA would process intermediaries’ data and claims or performance, including the privacy of customer data on strategies. This raises concerns about how the agency would handle sensitive information and ensure data privacy and security, as the data is very sensitive in nature, data breaches or leaks could have significant consequences.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Lastly, as the PVA would be a SEBI-recognised entity, investors may cultivate an unwarranted sense of assurance by placing exclusive reliance on claims that have undergone PVA validation. It is imperative to emphasize that historical performance, albeit a significant metric, is not an unequivocal determinant of future outcomes in the realm of investment. Instead, prudent investment decisions necessitate a comprehensive consideration of multiple variables beyond historical performance data.\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"Conclusion\",\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"SEBI’s proposal to establish the PVA is a commendable step toward enhancing transparency and credibility in India’s financial markets. This initiative aims to provide investors with verified performance data, fostering a more informed investment culture. While there are concerns, such as potential challenges for smaller players and data privacy issues, these can be addressed through tailored regulations and robust security measures. The prospects offered by the PVA are promising. It can introduce standardised validation processes, shifting the focus from self-declared claims to accountable and verified performance data. Investors will benefit from reliable information, and credible intermediaries will gain recognition. To succeed, the PVA must strike a balance between transparency and the need to prevent overburdening market participants. Collaboration, innovation in validation methods, and data protection measures are essential. Ultimately, this initiative requires collective efforts from stakeholders to build trust in the financial ecosystem, benefiting investors and the market.\",\n",

Under the Act, parties can approach the Court under section 9 of the Act to seek interim reliefs before, or during the arbitral proceedings, or at any time after the passing of the award but before it is enforced. Interim reliefs are an essential safeguard provided under the Act to ensure that any claims which a party wishes to raise in the arbitration are protected in the form of security, guarantees or other measures as the Court may deem fit, based on a case-to-case assessment. Post the constitution of the arbitral tribunal, the tribunal itself is also empowered to grant interim reliefs to parties under section 17 of the Act.\",\n",

One of these changes was the amendment to section 9 of the Act. Through the addition of sub-section (3) to section 9, the court’s powers to grant interim reliefs were truncated, once the arbitral tribunal had been constituted. The 2015 Amendment also introduced a deeming fiction in section 17, to ensure that orders of the arbitral tribunal in respect of interim reliefs would have the same effect as, and could be enforced on the same strength as, orders of the competent Court under section 9. The addition of sub-section (3) to section 9 recognised that since the powers to grant interim reliefs had effectively been made equal for both courts and arbitral tribunals after the 2015 Amendment, parties should raise their claims for such interim reliefs before the tribunal, once it is constituted.\",\n",

However, the restriction placed on the Court’s scope under section 9 by sub-section (3) is based on two assertions. First, on its power to ‘entertain’ an application under sub-section (1), and second, qualified by an assessment of whether there exist circumstances which may render the remedy of interim relief under section 17 inefficacious. Therefore,  a section 9 court does not become coram non judice as soon as the arbitral tribunal is constituted. Further, its jurisdiction is also not completely taken away through sub-section (3), as it is not meant to operate as an ouster clause.\",\n",

As was explained by the Supreme Court in Arcelor Mittal Nippon Steel India Ltd. v Essar Bulk Terminal Ltd., such a situation could arise in circumstances where the arbitral tribunal is unavailable due to reasons of illness etc., where members of the arbitral tribunal cannot congregate on short notice to decide the urgency in the interim application, or where the constitution of the tribunal itself is under challenge on grounds of bias etc. inter alia. Since interim reliefs are, by their very nature, urgent and require immediate intervention, the Supreme Court in Arcellor Mittal held that the intention of the legislature under section 9 would therefore not be to denude the court’s powers – particularly in situations where the tribunal’s indisposition would render availing such remedy under section 17 inefficacious.\",\n",

In Arcellor Mittal, the Supreme Court held that the word ‘entertain’ under section 9(3) means when a court under section 9 has applied its mind to the issues raised in the application, and has considered it on merits. It concluded that while such a process might even extend till the pronouncement of the order on such an application, it would not preclude the court from exercising its powers under section 9 even if the tribunal was constituted during this stage.\",\n",

The intent was never, as the Supreme Court observed, to “turn back the clock” and require the arbitral tribunal to re-consider an application for interim relief which has already been seized of by the section 9 court.\",\n",

While the parties filed affidavits towards their respective positions in the section 9 proceedings, the arbitral tribunal was constituted in the interregnum. The High Court, applying the ratio in Arcellor Mittal, held that while the level of a court’s engagement with an application may be subjective depending on each case (and at which point the tribunal stood constituted), it was clear that in the present case that the High Court had effectively ‘entertained’ the said application when the tribunal was constituted. The intention under section 9(3), the High Court reiterated, was not to “rewind the clock”. It was to prevent multiple hearings on the same relief claimed by the parties, as a result of which once the Court has ‘entertained’ the application – by applying its mind to the issues at hand and considering it on merits – the hands of the metaphorical clock under section 9, and sub-section (3) specifically, stop to tick.\",\n",
